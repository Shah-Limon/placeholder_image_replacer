## Keeping Your Ice Cold: How To Clean Your Frigidaire Ice Maker Efic235

Is your Frigidaire Efic235 ice maker not producing ice as efficiently as it used to? Or perhaps you've noticed an odd taste or smell? Regular cleaning is the key to maintaining optimal performance and ensuring your ice is always fresh and safe. This article will walk you through a comprehensive cleaning process for your Frigidaire Efic235 ice maker, helping you keep it running smoothly for years to come. We’ll cover everything from daily upkeep to deep cleaning, ensuring you have all the information you need.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly empty the ice bin.
*   Clean the exterior with mild soap and water.
*   Descale the ice maker with a vinegar solution.
*   Sanitize the water reservoir and components.
*   Replace the water filter as recommended.

**Quick Answer:** To clean your Frigidaire Efic235 ice maker, unplug it, empty the ice bin, wash the bin and components with warm soapy water, descale with a vinegar solution, sanitize, and rinse thoroughly before plugging it back in.

## Why Cleaning Your Frigidaire Efic235 Ice Maker Matters

Cleaning your Frigidaire Efic235 isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about hygiene and functionality. Over time, mineral deposits from water can build up inside the ice maker, reducing its efficiency and potentially affecting the taste of your ice. These deposits, known as scale, can also harbor bacteria and mold, which can contaminate your ice. A clean ice maker produces better-tasting ice and lasts longer.  Regular maintenance prevents costly repairs down the line.

## Daily & Weekly Maintenance for a Sparkling Clean Ice Maker

Small, consistent efforts make a big difference in maintaining your Frigidaire Efic235. Daily, simply empty the ice bin to prevent old ice from accumulating and potentially affecting the flavor of new ice. Weekly, wipe down the exterior of the ice maker with a damp cloth and mild dish soap. This removes dust, fingerprints, and spills.  Don't forget to check the water filter; a clogged filter impacts ice production.

*   **Empty the Ice Bin Daily:** Prevents stale ice and potential contamination.
*   **Wipe Down Exterior Weekly:** Keeps the appliance looking its best.
*   **Inspect Water Filter:** Ensure optimal water flow and ice quality.

## Deep Cleaning Your Frigidaire Efic235: A Step-by-Step Guide

A deep clean should be performed every 3-6 months, depending on your water hardness and usage. First, and most importantly, unplug the ice maker from the power outlet. This is a crucial safety step. Next, remove the ice bin and any removable parts, such as the water reservoir and filter housing. Wash these components with warm, soapy water and a soft sponge. Rinse thoroughly and allow them to air dry completely.

## Descaling Your Frigidaire Efic235 Ice Maker

Descaling removes mineral buildup that impacts performance.  Mix equal parts white vinegar and water. Pour the solution into the water reservoir, following the manufacturer’s instructions for the maximum fill level. Run the ice maker through a full cycle, allowing the vinegar solution to circulate through the system. After the cycle is complete, discard the solution and rinse the reservoir thoroughly with clean water.

*   **Vinegar Solution:** Equal parts vinegar and water effectively dissolve mineral deposits.
*   **Full Cycle:** Allows the solution to reach all internal components.
*   **Thorough Rinse:** Removes any lingering vinegar taste or smell.

## Sanitizing and Final Rinse

After descaling, it’s important to sanitize the ice maker to eliminate any remaining bacteria. Mix one tablespoon of bleach with one gallon of water. Pour this solution into the water reservoir and run a full cycle.  After the cycle, discard the bleach solution and rinse the reservoir multiple times with clean water until there is no trace of bleach smell.  Reassemble all the components and plug the ice maker back in. Before using the ice, run a few cycles and discard the ice produced to ensure all traces of the cleaning solution are gone.

## Replacing the Water Filter

The water filter plays a vital role in the quality of your ice. A clogged or expired filter can lead to reduced ice production and a compromised taste. Refer to your Frigidaire Efic235 owner’s manual for the recommended filter replacement schedule. Typically, filters should be replaced every 6 months.  Always use a genuine Frigidaire replacement filter to ensure compatibility and optimal performance.
