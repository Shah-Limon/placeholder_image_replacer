## Keeping Your Readings Accurate: How To Clean An Exergen Temporal Scanner

Have you ever wondered how to properly maintain the accuracy of your Exergen Temporal Scanner? Regular cleaning is crucial for ensuring reliable temperature readings and preventing the spread of germs. This article will guide you through the simple steps to effectively clean your Exergen Temporal Scanner, keeping it in top working condition. We’ll cover everything from daily wipe-downs to more thorough disinfection procedures, ensuring you get the most out of your investment. Let’s dive in and learn how to keep your scanner clean and functioning optimally.

**Takeaway:**

*   Clean the scanner lens after each use with a 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe.
*   Disinfect the entire scanner regularly, especially in multi-patient settings.
*   Avoid harsh chemicals and abrasive cleaners that can damage the sensor.
*   Store the scanner in a clean, dry place when not in use.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean an Exergen Temporal Scanner, gently wipe the sensor lens after each use with a 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe. For full disinfection, use the same wipe on the entire scanner surface, avoiding the battery compartment. Always ensure the scanner is dry before use.

## Why Cleaning Your Exergen Scanner Matters

Maintaining a clean Exergen Temporal Scanner isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about accuracy and patient safety. A dirty lens can obstruct readings, leading to inaccurate temperature measurements. This is especially important in healthcare settings where precise readings are vital for diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, a contaminated scanner can become a breeding ground for bacteria and viruses, potentially spreading infection. Regular cleaning minimizes these risks, ensuring reliable performance and protecting both patients and healthcare professionals. 

## Daily Maintenance: Quick Wipe-Downs for Optimal Performance

The most important part of keeping your Exergen Temporal Scanner in good shape is a quick daily wipe-down. After *every* use, gently wipe the scanner lens with a 70% isopropyl alcohol wipe. This removes oils, debris, and potential contaminants that could affect readings. Don’t use abrasive materials, as these can scratch the lens. This simple step significantly contributes to the scanner’s accuracy and longevity.

## Deep Cleaning & Disinfection: A Step-by-Step Guide

While daily wipe-downs are essential, periodic deep cleaning and disinfection are also necessary, particularly in professional settings. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1.  **Power Off:** Ensure the scanner is turned off before cleaning.
2.  **Isopropyl Alcohol:** Dampen a clean, lint-free cloth with 70% isopropyl alcohol. *Never* spray the alcohol directly onto the scanner.
3.  **Wipe Down:** Gently wipe the entire scanner surface, including the lens, handle, and display.
4.  **Avoid Sensitive Areas:** Do *not* immerse the scanner in liquid or allow any liquid to enter the battery compartment.
5.  **Dry Thoroughly:** Allow the scanner to air dry completely before use.
6.  **Frequency:** In high-use environments, disinfect the scanner after each patient. For personal use, a weekly deep clean is usually sufficient.

## What *Not* To Use When Cleaning Your Exergen Scanner

Using the wrong cleaning agents can damage your Exergen Temporal Scanner. Avoid harsh chemicals like bleach, ammonia, or strong detergents. These can corrode the plastic components and damage the sensitive sensor. Abrasive cleaners and scouring pads will scratch the lens and display. Similarly, avoid using excessive moisture, as this can seep into the internal components and cause malfunction. Sticking to 70% isopropyl alcohol and a soft, lint-free cloth is the safest and most effective approach.

## Proper Storage: Protecting Your Investment

Proper storage is just as important as regular cleaning. When not in use, store your Exergen Temporal Scanner in a clean, dry place, away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures. A dedicated storage case is ideal, but a clean drawer or cabinet will also suffice. Avoid storing the scanner with other objects that could scratch or damage it. Protecting your scanner from the elements and physical damage will extend its lifespan and ensure continued accuracy.

## Troubleshooting: Addressing Common Cleaning Issues

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, you might encounter cleaning-related issues. If the lens appears cloudy after cleaning, try gently wiping it with a fresh, dry lint-free cloth. If the scanner malfunctions after being cleaned, ensure it is completely dry before attempting to use it again. If the problem persists, consult the Exergen user manual or contact customer support. Remember, preventative maintenance through regular cleaning is the best way to avoid these issues.
