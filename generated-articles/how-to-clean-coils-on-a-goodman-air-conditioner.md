## Keeping Your Cool: How To Clean Coils On A Goodman Air Conditioner

Is your Goodman air conditioner struggling to keep your home comfortable? A common culprit is dirty condenser and evaporator coils. These coils are responsible for heat transfer, and when covered in dust, dirt, and debris, they can’t work efficiently. Cleaning your AC coils is a simple maintenance task that can significantly improve performance, lower energy bills, and extend the life of your unit. This article will guide you through the process of cleaning both the condenser and evaporator coils on your Goodman air conditioner. We’ll cover everything from safety precautions to step-by-step instructions, ensuring you can tackle this task with confidence.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular coil cleaning improves AC efficiency.
*   Dirty coils increase energy consumption.
*   Cleaning is a DIY-friendly maintenance task.
*   Proper cleaning extends the lifespan of your Goodman AC unit.

**Quick Answer:** Cleaning the coils on your Goodman air conditioner involves turning off the power, removing debris, applying coil cleaner, and rinsing with water. This process improves airflow and heat transfer, leading to better cooling and lower energy bills.

## Understanding Your Goodman AC Coils

Your Goodman air conditioner has two main sets of coils: the condenser coil and the evaporator coil. Knowing the difference is key to cleaning them properly. The condenser coil is located in the outdoor unit and releases heat. The evaporator coil is inside the indoor unit and absorbs heat. Both coils need regular cleaning to function optimally. Dust and dirt act as insulation, preventing efficient heat exchange. This forces your AC to work harder, consuming more energy and potentially leading to costly repairs. 

## Safety First: Preparing to Clean Your AC Coils

Before you begin, safety is paramount. Always disconnect the power to your air conditioner at the breaker box. This prevents electrical shock. Next, gather your supplies. You’ll need:

*   Screwdriver (to access the coils)
*   Fin comb (to straighten bent fins)
*   AC coil cleaner (specifically designed for air conditioners – avoid harsh chemicals)
*   Garden hose with a spray nozzle
*   Gloves and eye protection
*   Vacuum with brush attachment

Protecting yourself and your equipment is crucial. Wear gloves to protect your hands from the cleaner and debris, and eye protection to prevent splashes. [Learn more about general air conditioner cleaning](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-air-conditioner) for additional safety tips.

## Cleaning the Condenser Coils (Outdoor Unit)

The condenser coils are typically easier to access and clean. Start by removing any large debris like leaves, twigs, and grass clippings from around the outdoor unit. Then, carefully remove the outer casing to expose the condenser coils. Use a vacuum with a brush attachment to gently remove loose dirt and dust. Be careful not to bend the delicate fins. 

If the fins are bent, use a fin comb to carefully straighten them. Bent fins restrict airflow, reducing efficiency. Next, apply the AC coil cleaner according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Let it sit for the recommended time, then rinse thoroughly with a garden hose. Spray from the inside out to avoid bending the fins.

## Cleaning the Evaporator Coils (Indoor Unit)

Cleaning the evaporator coils is a bit more involved. First, access the coils, usually located within the air handler. You may need to remove an access panel. Like the condenser coils, use a vacuum with a brush attachment to remove loose debris. The evaporator coils are more prone to mold and mildew growth due to condensation. 

Apply the AC coil cleaner, paying attention to areas with visible mold. Let it sit, then rinse gently with water. Be careful not to get water on any electrical components. If you notice significant mold growth, consider contacting a professional for a thorough cleaning.

## Dealing with Stubborn Dirt and Debris

Sometimes, dirt and debris are particularly stubborn. For heavily soiled coils, you may need to repeat the cleaning process. You can also use a soft brush to gently scrub the coils after applying the cleaner. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or tools, as these can damage the fins. If you're dealing with a lot of grime, consider using a coil cleaner specifically designed for heavy-duty cleaning. Remember to always rinse thoroughly after using any cleaner.
