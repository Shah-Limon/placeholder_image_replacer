## Understanding Dungeness Crab Anatomy

Before diving in, it’s helpful to understand the basic anatomy of a Dungeness crab. Knowing what you’re looking at will make the cleaning process much easier.

## Tools You’ll Need to Clean Dungeness Crab

Having the right tools makes cleaning Dungeness crab a breeze. You won’t need anything fancy, just a few essentials. Here’s what you should gather:

*   **Sturdy Gloves:** Protect your hands from sharp shell edges.
*   **Kitchen Shears or a Heavy Knife:** For splitting the crab.
*   **A Stiff Brush:** For scrubbing away any debris.
*   **A Large Bowl:** For rinsing the crab.
*   **A Spoon or Small Tool:** For removing the gills and internal organs.
*   **Running Cold Water:** Essential for rinsing throughout the process.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning a Dungeness Crab

Now, let's get to the cleaning process. Follow these steps for a perfectly cleaned Dungeness crab.

1.  **Chill the Crab:** If the crab is still alive, place it in the freezer for about 15-20 minutes to make it dormant. This is a more humane approach.
2.  **Remove the Top Shell:** Hold the crab firmly and insert the tip of your kitchen shears or knife into the shell near the back. Gently pry the shell open, working your way around until it separates.
3.  **Clean the Gills:** You’ll see feathery, gray gills attached to the body. Use a spoon or your fingers (with gloves!) to remove and discard these.  Be thorough, as the gills can impart a bitter flavor.
4.  **Remove the Internal Organs:** Locate the apron, a flap on the underside of the crab. Lift the apron and you’ll find the internal organs. Remove and discard these as well.
5.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Rinse the crab under cold running water, ensuring all debris and remnants are removed.  Pay attention to the legs and crevices.
6.  **Crack the Legs (Optional):** You can crack the legs now for easier cooking, or leave them whole.

## Cleaning Dungeness Crab Legs

Cleaning the legs is just as important as cleaning the body. The legs contain a lot of delicious meat, but they can also harbor some grit.  Start by rinsing the legs under cold water. Use a small brush to scrub away any debris. You can also use kitchen shears to cut along the legs to help remove any remaining shell fragments.

## Preparing the Crab for Cooking

Once the crab is cleaned, it’s ready for cooking. There are several ways to cook Dungeness crab, including steaming, boiling, and roasting. Steaming is often preferred as it helps retain the crab’s natural flavor.  Before cooking, you can season the crab with salt, pepper, and any other desired spices.  Consider adding bay leaves or Old Bay seasoning to the cooking water for extra flavor.

## Storing Cleaned Dungeness Crab

If you’re not cooking the crab immediately, it’s important to store it properly. Place the cleaned crab in an airtight container and refrigerate it for up to 24 hours.  You can also freeze the crab for longer storage.  Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and then place it in a freezer bag. Frozen crab can be stored for up to 3 months.
