## Step 1: Preparing the Area and Initial Rinse

Start by giving the door jambs a quick rinse with water. This will remove loose dirt and debris, making the cleaning process more effective. Use a gentle spray of water from a hose or a spray bottle. Avoid high-pressure washing, as this could damage the paint or seals.

Next, inspect the jambs for any areas with heavy buildup or rust. This will help you focus your cleaning efforts. You can also use this time to protect your car's paint by placing towels along the door edges to prevent scratches.

## Step 2: Applying the Cleaning Solution

Now it’s time to apply your cleaning solution. Mix your all-purpose cleaner with warm water in a bucket, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Pour the solution into a spray bottle for easy application. 

Spray the cleaning solution liberally onto the door jambs, ensuring all surfaces are covered. Let the solution sit for a few minutes to allow it to break down the dirt and grime. For stubborn stains, you can reapply the solution and let it dwell for a longer period.

## Step 3: Scrubbing and Reaching Tight Spots

Using your soft brush, begin scrubbing the door jambs to remove any remaining dirt and grime. Pay close attention to areas where dirt tends to accumulate, such as the edges and corners. A detailing brush is ideal for reaching tight spots and crevices. 

For stubborn stains or rust spots, apply a little extra pressure and scrub in a circular motion. Remember to be gentle to avoid damaging the paint.

## Step 4: Rinsing and Drying the Door Jambs

Once you’ve scrubbed the door jambs, rinse them thoroughly with clean water. Make sure to remove all traces of the cleaning solution. Use a clean microfiber towel to dry the jambs completely. 

Drying is crucial, as any remaining water can lead to rust or water spots. Pay attention to any areas where water might pool, and wipe them dry with a separate towel. You can also use compressed air to blow away any remaining water droplets.

## Step 5: Protecting with Wax or Sealant (Optional)

To protect your freshly cleaned door jambs, you can apply a coat of wax or sealant. This will help repel water and dirt, keeping them cleaner for longer. Apply a thin, even coat of wax or sealant using a clean microfiber towel. 

Allow the wax or sealant to dry according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This step is optional, but it can significantly extend the life of your clean door jambs.
