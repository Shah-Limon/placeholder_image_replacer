## How to Clean Cambria: A Complete Guide

Is your Cambria quartz countertop looking a little dull? Don't worry, restoring its shine is easier than you think! Cambria is a popular choice for kitchens and bathrooms because of its durability and beauty. This article will walk you through everything you need to know to effectively clean Cambria, from daily maintenance to tackling stubborn stains. We’ll cover the best cleaning solutions, tools, and techniques to keep your surfaces looking their best for years to come.

**Takeaway:**

*   Use a soft cloth and warm water for daily cleaning.
*   Avoid abrasive cleaners and scouring pads.
*   Clean spills immediately to prevent staining.
*   Use a Cambria-approved cleaner for deeper cleaning.

**What is the best way to clean Cambria quartz?**

Daily cleaning of Cambria quartz involves wiping down the surface with a soft cloth dampened with warm water. For tougher messes, use a Cambria-approved cleaner or a mild dish soap solution, followed by rinsing and drying. Avoid harsh chemicals and abrasive materials to maintain the surface's integrity.

## Understanding Cambria Quartz & Its Cleaning Needs

Cambria quartz isn’t natural stone; it’s an engineered surface made of about 93% natural quartz and 7% resin. This composition makes it incredibly durable and non-porous, meaning it resists staining and bacteria growth better than granite or marble. However, it's still important to clean it properly to maintain its luster and prevent damage. Understanding its composition helps you choose the right cleaning methods. You want to protect that resin binder!

## Daily Cleaning for a Sparkling Surface

Keeping your Cambria countertops clean doesn’t have to be a chore. A quick daily wipe-down is often all it takes. Start with a soft microfiber cloth and warm water. This removes everyday spills and dust, preventing buildup. For a little extra cleaning power, you can add a drop of mild dish soap to the water. Remember to always rinse the surface thoroughly with clean water and dry it with a clean cloth to avoid water spots.

## Choosing the Right Cleaning Products

Selecting the right cleaning product is crucial for preserving your Cambria’s beauty. Avoid harsh chemicals like bleach, ammonia, and abrasive cleaners. These can dull the surface or even damage the resin. Instead, opt for pH-neutral cleaners specifically designed for quartz surfaces. Cambria offers its own line of cleaning products, but many gentle dish soaps and all-purpose cleaners are also suitable. Always test any new cleaner in an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn’t cause discoloration.

## Tackling Common Stains on Cambria

Even with regular cleaning, stains can happen. The good news is that most stains are easily removed from Cambria. 

*   **Food Stains:** Wipe up spills immediately with a damp cloth. For dried-on food, use a plastic scraper to gently remove the residue, then clean with a mild cleaner.
*   **Oil-Based Stains:** These can be removed with a degreasing cleaner or a paste of baking soda and water. Let the paste sit for a few minutes before wiping away.
*   **Ink Stains:** Try rubbing alcohol on a soft cloth. Gently blot the stain, working from the outside in.
*   **Hard Water Spots:** A solution of vinegar and water can help dissolve hard water deposits. Rinse thoroughly after use.

For particularly stubborn stains, consider using a Cambria Stain Removal Kit. [You can find more information on cleaning quartz countertops here](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-cambria-quartz-countertops).

## Deep Cleaning Your Cambria Surfaces

While daily cleaning keeps things tidy, a deep clean is recommended every few months. This helps remove any accumulated grime and restore the surface’s shine. Begin by clearing the countertops completely. Then, spray the surface with a Cambria-approved cleaner and let it sit for a few minutes. Use a soft cloth or sponge to scrub gently, paying attention to areas with visible buildup. Rinse thoroughly with clean water and dry with a clean microfiber cloth. This process will leave your Cambria looking refreshed and revitalized.

## Protecting Your Cambria Investment

Preventative care is the best way to keep your Cambria countertops looking beautiful. Always use cutting boards when preparing food to avoid scratches. Place hot pads under hot pots and pans to prevent heat damage. Avoid dragging heavy objects across the surface. Finally, clean up spills immediately to prevent staining. Following these simple tips will help you protect your investment and enjoy your Cambria countertops for years to come.
