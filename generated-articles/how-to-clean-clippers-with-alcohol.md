## Keeping Your Blades Sharp: How To Clean Clippers With Alcohol

Have you ever wondered how to keep your hair clippers in top condition? Regular cleaning is essential, and using alcohol is a fantastic way to disinfect and maintain them. Dirty clippers can harbor bacteria, dull quickly, and even cause skin irritation. This article will walk you through a simple, effective process for cleaning your clippers with alcohol, ensuring they stay sharp, hygienic, and ready for their next use. We’ll cover everything from gathering your supplies to the final oiling step.

**Takeaway:**

*   Disinfect clippers with isopropyl alcohol to kill bacteria.
*   Remove hair debris before applying alcohol.
*   Lubricate after cleaning to maintain blade performance.
*   Regular cleaning extends clipper lifespan and ensures hygiene.

**Quick Answer:** To clean clippers with alcohol, unplug them, remove hair with a brush, spray or apply isopropyl alcohol (70% or higher) to the blades, let it sit for a few minutes, then wipe clean and oil the blades.

## Why Clean Clippers With Alcohol?

Using alcohol to clean your clippers offers several benefits. First and foremost, it’s a powerful disinfectant. Isopropyl alcohol effectively kills bacteria and viruses, which is crucial when dealing with tools used close to the skin. This is especially important for barbers and stylists who use clippers on multiple clients. Secondly, alcohol helps dissolve oil and grime buildup that can slow down the blades and affect their performance. Finally, alcohol evaporates quickly, leaving no residue behind. This prevents the blades from becoming sticky or attracting more debris. 

Regular cleaning with alcohol isn’t just about hygiene; it’s about preserving your investment. Well-maintained clippers last longer and provide a better cutting experience.

## Gathering Your Supplies

Before you begin, make sure you have everything you need. This will streamline the cleaning process and ensure you don’t have to stop mid-way through. Here’s a list of essential supplies:

*   **Isopropyl Alcohol (70% or higher):** This is the key ingredient for disinfecting and cleaning.
*   **Small Brush:** A toothbrush or a specialized clipper cleaning brush is perfect for removing hair and debris.
*   **Spray Bottle (Optional):**  A spray bottle makes applying the alcohol easier, but you can also use a cloth.
*   **Clipper Oil:** Essential for lubricating the blades after cleaning.
*   **Clean Cloth or Paper Towels:** For wiping away excess alcohol and debris.
*   **Screwdriver (If disassembling):** Some clippers benefit from a deeper clean that requires disassembly.

Having these items readily available will make the cleaning process quick and efficient. Remember, proper preparation is half the battle!

## Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Your Clippers

Now, let's get down to the actual cleaning process. Follow these steps for optimal results:

1.  **Unplug the Clippers:** Safety first! Always disconnect the clippers from the power source before cleaning.
2.  **Remove Hair and Debris:** Use the small brush to thoroughly remove any visible hair, lint, or debris from the blades and clipper body. Pay close attention to the teeth of the blades.
3.  **Apply the Alcohol:** Spray the blades with isopropyl alcohol, ensuring complete coverage. Alternatively, dampen a clean cloth with alcohol and wipe the blades thoroughly.
4.  **Let it Sit:** Allow the alcohol to sit on the blades for 5-10 minutes. This gives it time to disinfect and dissolve any remaining grime.
5.  **Wipe Clean:** Use a clean cloth or paper towel to wipe away the alcohol and loosened debris.
6.  **Oil the Blades:** Apply a few drops of clipper oil to the blades. Turn the clippers on briefly to distribute the oil evenly.
7.  **Wipe Excess Oil:** Wipe away any excess oil with a clean cloth.

Following these steps consistently will keep your clippers in excellent condition.

## Deep Cleaning: Disassembling Your Clippers

For a more thorough clean, you can disassemble your clippers. *Note: This may void your warranty, so check your manufacturer’s instructions first.*

1.  **Consult Your Manual:** Refer to your clipper’s manual for specific disassembly instructions.
2.  **Remove the Blade:** Carefully remove the blade assembly from the clipper body.
3.  **Clean Individual Parts:** Clean each part (blade, housing, etc.) with isopropyl alcohol and a brush.
4.  **Reassemble:** Once all parts are dry, carefully reassemble the clippers.
5.  **Oil and Test:** Oil the blades and test the clippers to ensure they are functioning correctly.

Disassembling your clippers allows you to reach areas that are difficult to clean otherwise. However, it’s important to be careful and follow the manufacturer’s instructions to avoid damaging the clippers.

## How Often Should You Clean Your Clippers?

The frequency of cleaning depends on how often you use your clippers. 

*   **Professional Use (Multiple Clients Daily):** Clean and disinfect after *each* client.
*   **Frequent Home Use (Several Times a Week):** Clean and oil after *each* use.
*   **Occasional Home Use (Once a Month or Less):** Clean and oil *before and after* each use.

Regular cleaning prevents buildup and ensures optimal performance. Don't underestimate the importance of consistent maintenance.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

Sometimes, even with regular cleaning, you might encounter issues with your clippers. Here are a few common problems and solutions:

*   **Blades Feel Sticky:** This is usually caused by oil buildup. Clean the blades thoroughly with alcohol and re-oil.
*   **Clipper is Running Slow:** This could be due to dull blades or a lack of lubrication. Sharpen the blades (if possible) and oil them generously.
*   **Clipper is Overheating:** This could be a sign of a motor problem. Discontinue use and consult a professional.
*   **Rust on Blades:** Remove rust with a specialized rust remover and then clean and oil the blades.

Addressing these issues promptly can prevent further damage and extend the life of your clippers.



## FAQ About Cleaning Clippers With Alcohol

**Q: Can I use hand sanitizer instead of isopropyl alcohol?**

A: While hand sanitizer contains alcohol, it also includes other ingredients like moisturizers that can leave a residue on the blades. Isopropyl alcohol is the preferred choice for cleaning clippers as it evaporates cleanly.

**Q: Is 70% isopropyl alcohol as effective as 90%?**

A: Both 70% and 90% isopropyl alcohol are effective disinfectants. 70% alcohol is often preferred because it contains some water, which helps it penetrate bacterial cell walls more effectively.

**Q: Can I submerge the entire clipper in alcohol?**

A: No, do not submerge the entire clipper in alcohol. This can damage the motor and other internal components. Only apply alcohol to the blades and exterior surfaces.

**Q: How do I know if my blades need sharpening?**

A: If your clippers are pulling hair instead of cutting it cleanly, or if they feel dull to the touch, it’s likely time to sharpen the blades.



## Conclusion

Cleaning your clippers with alcohol is a simple yet crucial step in maintaining their performance and hygiene. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can ensure your clippers stay sharp, disinfected, and ready for any grooming task. Remember to clean regularly, oil the blades after each use, and address any issues promptly. Investing a little time in clipper maintenance will save you money in the long run and provide a better cutting experience. So, grab your isopropyl alcohol and keep those blades gleaming!
