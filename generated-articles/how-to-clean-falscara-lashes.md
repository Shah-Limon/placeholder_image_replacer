**What's the best way to clean Falscara lashes?**

Cleaning Falscara lashes involves gently removing makeup, oil, and debris with a lash-safe cleanser and a soft brush. Daily cleaning helps prevent buildup, keeps your natural lashes healthy, and extends the lifespan of your Falscara application.

## Why Cleaning Your Falscara Lashes is So Important

Let's face it, beautiful lashes deserve a little extra care. Cleaning your Falscara lashes isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about hygiene and longevity. Over time, makeup, oils from your skin, and everyday debris can accumulate at the base of the lashes. This buildup can lead to irritation, inflammation, and even infection. Regularly cleaning your lashes removes these impurities, keeping your eyes healthy and your lashes looking their best. Plus, clean lashes adhere better, meaning your Falscara will last longer!

## Gathering Your Cleaning Supplies

Before you begin, make sure you have everything you need. You won’t need a ton of products, which is great! Here’s a checklist:

*   **Falscara Lash Cleanser:** This is specifically formulated for lash extensions and is gentle enough for the delicate eye area. Avoid anything with oil!
*   **Soft Brush:** A clean, soft makeup brush (like an eyeshadow brush) or a dedicated lash brush works perfectly.
*   **Lint-Free Applicators:** These are great for removing excess cleanser and debris.
*   **Distilled Water:** For rinsing, distilled water is best to avoid any potential irritants.
*   **Clean Towel:** To gently pat your lashes dry.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Falscara Lashes

Now for the main event! Here’s how to clean your Falscara lashes effectively:

1.  **Remove Makeup:** Before cleaning your lashes, remove all eye makeup with a gentle, oil-free makeup remover. [Learn more about removing makeup effectively here](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-blender).
2.  **Apply Cleanser:** Dampen your soft brush with the Falscara lash cleanser. Gently brush the cleanser along your lash line, focusing on the base of the lashes where buildup tends to accumulate.
3.  **Gentle Scrubbing:** Use the brush to gently scrub the lashes in a downward motion. Avoid harsh rubbing, as this can damage the lashes or irritate your eyes.
4.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Use distilled water to rinse away the cleanser. You can use a lint-free applicator to help remove any remaining residue.
5.  **Pat Dry:** Gently pat your lashes dry with a clean towel. Avoid rubbing, as this can also cause damage.
6.  **Brush & Fluff:** Once dry, use a clean spoolie or lash brush to gently brush and fluff your lashes back into shape.

## How Often Should You Clean Your Falscara Lashes?

Consistency is key when it comes to lash care. Ideally, you should clean your Falscara lashes *every day*. Daily cleaning prevents buildup and keeps your lashes looking fresh. If you wear a lot of eye makeup, you might consider cleaning them twice a day – once to remove makeup and again before bed. Think of it like brushing your teeth; regular cleaning is essential for maintaining good hygiene.

## What to Avoid When Cleaning Falscara Lashes

Certain products and practices can damage your Falscara lashes or irritate your eyes. Here’s what to steer clear of:

*   **Oil-Based Products:** Oil breaks down the adhesive that holds your Falscara lashes in place. Avoid oil-based makeup removers, cleansers, and skincare products near your eyes.
*   **Cotton Swabs:** Cotton swabs can leave behind lint, which can get stuck in your lashes.
*   **Mascara (Generally):** While some Falscara-safe mascaras exist, most traditional mascaras can damage the lashes.
*   **Harsh Rubbing:** As mentioned before, harsh rubbing can damage the lashes and irritate your eyes.
*   **Picking or Pulling:** Resist the urge to pick or pull at your lashes. This can damage your natural lashes and shorten the lifespan of your Falscara application.

## Extending the Life of Your Falscara Lashes with Proper Care

Beyond daily cleaning, there are other things you can do to extend the life of your Falscara lashes. Avoid sleeping on your stomach, as this can crush the lashes. Be gentle when removing eye makeup, and avoid using waterproof formulas. [Keeping your home clean can also contribute to healthier lashes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-apartment) by reducing airborne irritants. Finally, schedule regular Falscara fills to maintain a full and beautiful look.
