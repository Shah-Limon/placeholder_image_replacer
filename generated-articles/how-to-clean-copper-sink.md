However, sometimes you want to brighten it up or remove stubborn stains. This article will show you exactly how to clean your copper sink, from daily maintenance to tackling tough messes. We’ll cover everything you need to know to keep your sink looking its best, protecting your investment for years to come.

## Understanding the Copper Sink Patina

A copper sink isn’t like stainless steel; it changes over time. The beautiful coloration you see is called a patina, formed by the copper reacting with air and water. This patina protects the copper, and many people appreciate its unique, aged appearance. However, you can control the level of patina and brighten the copper when desired. Understanding this process is key to effective cleaning.

## Daily & Weekly Maintenance for a Gleaming Sink

Consistent, simple care is the best way to maintain your copper sink. After each use, rinse the sink thoroughly with warm water to remove food particles and soap residue. Weekly, use a mild dish soap and a soft sponge to gently scrub the entire surface. This prevents buildup and keeps the sink looking fresh. 

*   Avoid abrasive scrubbers, as they can scratch the copper.
*   Always rinse thoroughly after using soap.
*   Dry the sink with a soft cloth to prevent water spots.

## Protecting Your Copper Sink's Patina

While you can brighten your copper sink, protecting the patina is often desired. Avoid harsh chemicals like bleach or ammonia, as they can strip the patina and damage the copper. Also, be mindful of acidic foods and liquids, as they can etch the surface. Regular waxing with a copper wax can help protect the patina and prevent water spots.

*   Avoid abrasive cleaners.
*   Don't use bleach or ammonia.
*   Consider a copper wax for protection.

Knowing what *not* to do is just as important as knowing what *to* do. Never use abrasive cleaners, steel wool, or scouring pads, as these will scratch the copper. Avoid harsh chemicals like bleach, ammonia, and drain cleaners. These can damage the patina and even corrode the copper. Finally, don't leave acidic foods or liquids sitting in the sink for extended periods.
