## Revitalize Your Tile: How to Clean Grout With Oxiclean

Is your grout looking dingy and stained? Don't worry, you're not alone! Grout is notorious for attracting dirt, grime, and mildew, especially in high-traffic areas like kitchens and bathrooms. Fortunately, you don't need harsh chemicals or expensive professional cleaning services to restore its sparkle. This article will show you how to effectively clean grout with Oxiclean, a readily available and powerful cleaning agent. We’ll cover everything from preparing your solution to scrubbing and rinsing, leaving you with beautifully clean tile and grout.

**Takeaway:**

*   Oxiclean is a safe and effective way to clean grout.
*   Proper preparation and ventilation are key for best results.
*   A good scrub brush and patience are essential for removing stubborn stains.
*   Rinsing thoroughly prevents residue buildup.

**Quick Answer:** To clean grout with Oxiclean, mix Oxiclean powder with water to form a paste, apply it to the grout lines, let it sit for 10-30 minutes, scrub with a brush, and rinse thoroughly with clean water.

## Why Oxiclean Works Wonders on Grout

Oxiclean’s power comes from its active ingredient, sodium percarbonate, which releases oxygen when mixed with water. This oxygenating action helps to lift dirt, grime, and stains from porous surfaces like grout. It’s a fantastic alternative to bleach, as it’s color-safe and less harsh on your lungs and the environment. Plus, many people already have Oxiclean on hand, making it a convenient and cost-effective cleaning solution.  It’s particularly effective on common grout stains like mildew, soap scum, and everyday dirt buildup.

## Preparing Your Oxiclean Grout Cleaning Solution

Before you start scrubbing, you need to create the perfect Oxiclean solution. There are two main methods: a paste and a spray. The paste is ideal for stubborn stains and targeted cleaning, while the spray is better for larger areas. 

Here’s how to make each:

*   **Oxiclean Paste:** Mix 1/2 cup of Oxiclean powder with enough water to form a thick paste. The consistency should be similar to toothpaste.
*   **Oxiclean Spray:** Dissolve 1/4 cup of Oxiclean powder in 1 gallon of warm water. Stir well until completely dissolved. Pour into a spray bottle.

Remember to always work in a well-ventilated area when using cleaning products. Opening windows or using a fan can help.

## Applying and Letting the Oxiclean Work Its Magic

Once your solution is ready, it’s time to apply it to the grout. For the paste, use an old toothbrush, a grout brush, or even your fingers (with gloves!) to apply it directly to the grout lines. Ensure you cover all the stained areas. For the spray, generously spray the grout lines, making sure they are thoroughly saturated. 

Now, the important part: let it sit! Allow the Oxiclean to work its magic for 10-30 minutes. For heavily stained grout, you can let it sit for up to an hour, but keep an eye on it to ensure it doesn’t dry out.  If you have dark-colored grout and are concerned about discoloration, test the solution in an inconspicuous area first.

## Scrubbing Away the Grime: The Right Tools and Techniques

After the Oxiclean has had time to penetrate the grime, it’s time to scrub. A stiff-bristled brush is your best friend here. A grout brush is specifically designed for this purpose, but an old toothbrush or a small scrub brush will also work. 

Scrub the grout lines vigorously, using a back-and-forth motion. Pay extra attention to areas with heavy staining. You may need to apply some elbow grease, especially for older or deeply ingrained dirt.  For large areas, consider using a [best tile and grout cleaning machine](https://www.beacleaner.com/best-tile-and-grout-cleaning-machine) to save time and effort.  Don't forget to rinse your brush frequently to remove loosened dirt and grime.

## Rinsing and Drying: The Final Steps to Sparkling Grout

Once you’ve thoroughly scrubbed the grout, it’s crucial to rinse away all traces of the Oxiclean solution. Use clean, warm water and a sponge or cloth to wipe down the tile and grout lines. Rinse repeatedly until no soapy residue remains. 

Leftover Oxiclean residue can attract dirt and cause the grout to become stained again more quickly. After rinsing, use a clean, dry towel to dry the tile and grout. This will help prevent water spots and mildew growth.

## Dealing with Different Types of Grout

While Oxiclean is generally safe for most types of grout, it’s important to be aware of potential differences. 

*   **Epoxy Grout:** Epoxy grout is non-porous and more resistant to staining. Oxiclean can still be used, but you may need to let it sit for a shorter period and scrub less vigorously.  Learn more about cleaning this type of grout with our guide on [how to clean epoxy grout](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-epoxy-grout).
*   **Cementitious Grout:** This is the most common type of grout and is very porous. Oxiclean works exceptionally well on cementitious grout, but it may require more frequent cleaning to prevent staining.
*   **Sanded vs. Unsanded Grout:** Sanded grout has a slightly rougher texture and may require a bit more scrubbing. Unsanded grout is smoother and easier to clean.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Q: Is Oxiclean safe for colored grout?**
A: Generally, yes, Oxiclean is color-safe. However, it’s always best to test the solution in an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn’t cause any discoloration.

**Q: Can I use Oxiclean on all types of tile?**
A: Oxiclean is safe for most tile types, including ceramic, porcelain, and stone. However, avoid using it on delicate surfaces like marble or natural stone without testing it first.

**Q: How often should I clean my grout with Oxiclean?**
A: The frequency depends on the amount of traffic and the level of staining. A good rule of thumb is to clean your grout with Oxiclean every 1-3 months.

**Q: What if the Oxiclean doesn’t remove all the stains?**
A: For stubborn stains, you may need to repeat the process or try a stronger cleaning solution. You can also consider using a grout pen to touch up any remaining discoloration.
