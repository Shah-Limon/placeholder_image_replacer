## Understanding Your Hot Tub Shell Material

Before you start cleaning, it’s important to know what your hot tub shell is made of. Most hot tub shells are made from acrylic, but some older models may use fiberglass or other materials. Using the wrong cleaning products can damage the shell, so identifying the material is the first step. Acrylic shells are durable and relatively easy to clean, but they can be scratched by abrasive cleaners. 

*   **Acrylic:** The most common material, known for its durability and gloss.
*   **Fiberglass:** Older tubs may have fiberglass shells, which require gentler cleaning.
*   **Rotomolded Polyethylene:** Found in some less expensive tubs, this material is also relatively easy to clean.

Knowing your shell type will help you choose the right cleaning products and techniques. If you're unsure, check your hot tub's manual or contact the manufacturer.

## Gathering Your Cleaning Supplies

Having the right tools on hand makes the cleaning process much easier. You won’t need a lot, but selecting the correct items is key to a successful clean. Here’s a checklist of what you’ll need to clean your hot tub shell:

*   **pH-balanced hot tub shell cleaner:** Specifically formulated for hot tub surfaces.
*   **Soft cloths or sponges:** Microfiber cloths are ideal as they won’t scratch.
*   **Soft-bristled brush:** For tackling stubborn grime.
*   **Bucket:** For mixing cleaning solutions.
*   **Garden hose:** For rinsing.
*   **Gloves:** To protect your hands.

## Dealing with Stubborn Stains and Grime

Sometimes, despite regular cleaning, stubborn stains and grime can accumulate on your hot tub shell. Here are a few tips for tackling these challenges:

*   **Oil and Lotion Buildup:** Use a degreasing hot tub cleaner specifically designed for removing oils and lotions.
*   **Mineral Deposits:** White vinegar can help dissolve mineral deposits. Dilute vinegar with water (1:1 ratio) and apply to the affected area, letting it sit for a few minutes before scrubbing.
*   **Algae Growth:** If you notice algae growth, use an algae-specific hot tub cleaner.
*   **Waterline Rings:** A paste of baking soda and water can help remove waterline rings. Apply the paste, let it sit, and then scrub gently.

Always test any cleaning solution in an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn’t damage the shell. If you're dealing with a particularly dirty hot tub, you might also want to consider cleaning the [hot tub pipes](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-hot-tub-pipes) to ensure a thorough clean.
