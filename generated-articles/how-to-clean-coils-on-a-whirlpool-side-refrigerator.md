## Keeping Your Whirlpool Cool: How To Clean Refrigerator Coils

Is your Whirlpool side-by-side refrigerator not cooling as well as it used to? Do you notice it running more often, or your energy bill creeping up? The problem might be dirty condenser coils. Cleaning these coils is a simple task that can significantly improve your refrigerator’s performance and save you money. This guide will walk you through exactly how to clean the coils on your Whirlpool side-by-side refrigerator, ensuring it runs efficiently for years to come. We’ll cover everything from locating the coils to the best cleaning methods and preventative maintenance.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly cleaning your refrigerator coils (every 6-12 months) improves efficiency.
*   Dirty coils force the refrigerator to work harder, increasing energy consumption.
*   Cleaning is a simple DIY task that can extend the life of your appliance.

**Quick Answer:** To clean the coils on a Whirlpool side-by-side refrigerator, unplug the appliance, locate the coils (usually on the back or bottom), and use a vacuum with a brush attachment to remove dust and debris. This improves cooling efficiency and saves energy.

## Why Cleaning Your Refrigerator Coils Matters

Your refrigerator’s condenser coils are responsible for releasing heat. When these coils are covered in dust, pet hair, and other debris, they can’t efficiently dissipate heat. This forces the refrigerator’s compressor to work harder and longer to maintain the desired temperature. A stressed compressor leads to higher energy bills and a shorter lifespan for your appliance.  Think of it like trying to breathe through a clogged nose – it takes more effort!  Regular cleaning ensures optimal performance and prevents costly repairs down the line.

## Locating the Condenser Coils on Your Whirlpool Refrigerator

The location of the condenser coils varies depending on your specific Whirlpool side-by-side refrigerator model. However, they are typically found in one of two places: on the back of the refrigerator or underneath it. 

*   **Rear-Mounted Coils:** If your refrigerator has coils on the back, they will be visible as a series of metal fins. You’ll likely need to pull the refrigerator away from the wall to access them.
*   **Bottom-Mounted Coils:** Many newer Whirlpool refrigerators have coils located underneath the appliance. You’ll need to remove a lower access panel to reach them. Consult your refrigerator’s owner’s manual for specific instructions on removing the panel.

## Tools You’ll Need for Coil Cleaning

Before you start, gather the necessary tools. You won’t need anything fancy! Here’s a list of what you’ll need:

*   **Vacuum Cleaner:** A vacuum with a brush attachment is essential for removing dust and debris.
*   **Brush Attachment:** This is crucial for gently cleaning the delicate fins of the condenser coils. A soft-bristled brush is best.
*   **Screwdriver:** You may need a screwdriver to remove the access panel if the coils are located underneath the refrigerator.
*   **Gloves (Optional):**  Protect your hands from dust and grime.
*   **Flashlight:** Helpful for illuminating the coils, especially if they are in a dark space.



## Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Refrigerator Coils

Now that you have everything you need, let’s get started! Remember to prioritize safety by unplugging the refrigerator before beginning.

1.  **Unplug the Refrigerator:** This is the most important step! Disconnect the refrigerator from the power outlet to prevent electrical shock.
2.  **Locate and Access the Coils:**  Follow the instructions from the previous section to locate and access the condenser coils.
3.  **Vacuum the Coils:** Using the brush attachment on your vacuum cleaner, gently vacuum the coils. Work in a back-and-forth motion, being careful not to bend or damage the fins.  Start at the top and work your way down.
4.  **Inspect and Repeat:** After vacuuming, inspect the coils for any remaining dust or debris. Repeat the vacuuming process if necessary.
5.  **Clean the Surrounding Area:** While you have the access panel removed (if applicable), take the opportunity to vacuum the floor around the refrigerator.
6.  **Reassemble and Plug In:** Replace the access panel (if removed) and plug the refrigerator back into the power outlet.

## Dealing with Stubborn Dirt and Grime

Sometimes, vacuuming alone isn’t enough to remove stubborn dirt and grime from the condenser coils. In these cases, you can try a few additional methods.

*   **Coil Cleaning Brush:** A specialized coil cleaning brush can help loosen and remove stubborn debris. These brushes are designed specifically for cleaning refrigerator coils and are available at most hardware stores.
*   **Compressed Air:**  Compressed air can be used to blow dust and debris out of the coils. Be sure to wear eye protection when using compressed air.
*   **Mild Soap and Water (Use with Caution):** If the coils are particularly dirty, you can try gently cleaning them with a mixture of mild soap and water. *However, be extremely careful not to get any water on the electrical components of the refrigerator.*  Dry the coils thoroughly before plugging the refrigerator back in.

## Preventative Maintenance and Long-Term Care

Cleaning your refrigerator coils is a great start, but preventative maintenance can help keep them clean for longer. 

*   **Regular Vacuuming:** Vacuum the area around the refrigerator regularly to prevent dust from accumulating on the coils.
*   **Air Filter Replacement:** If your refrigerator has an air filter, replace it regularly according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
*   **Pet Hair Control:** If you have pets, keep them away from the refrigerator to minimize pet hair buildup on the coils.
*   **Professional Cleaning:** Consider having your refrigerator professionally cleaned every few years to ensure optimal performance.
