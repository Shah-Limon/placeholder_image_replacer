## Keeping Your Kitchen Safe: How to Clean Dishes That Touched Raw Chicken

Have you ever prepped chicken and then wondered just *how* thoroughly you need to clean the dishes it touched? It’s a valid concern! Raw chicken can harbor bacteria like Salmonella and Campylobacter, which can cause foodborne illness.  Properly cleaning dishes that have come into contact with raw chicken is crucial for protecting your family’s health. This article will walk you through a step-by-step process to ensure your dishes are safe and sanitized, giving you peace of mind. We’ll cover everything from pre-cleaning steps to effective sanitizing methods.

**Takeaway:**

*   Always scrape off excess chicken first.
*   Wash dishes in hot, soapy water.
*   Sanitize with bleach or a dishwasher’s sanitize cycle.
*   Air dry dishes completely.

**Quick Answer:** To clean dishes that touched raw chicken, first remove any food particles. Then, wash thoroughly in hot, soapy water, followed by sanitizing with a bleach solution or a hot dishwasher cycle. Finally, allow the dishes to air dry completely to prevent recontamination.

## Understanding the Risks of Raw Chicken Contamination

Raw chicken often contains harmful bacteria. These bacteria aren’t visible to the naked eye, making it easy to unknowingly spread them around your kitchen.  Cross-contamination happens when these bacteria transfer from the chicken to surfaces, utensils, and dishes.  This is why a dedicated cleaning process is so important.  Ignoring proper cleaning can lead to unpleasant symptoms like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever.  Let's ensure your kitchen remains a safe space for food preparation.

## Step 1: Pre-Cleaning – Removing the Bulk of the Contamination

Before you even think about washing, scrape off any visible pieces of raw chicken from the dishes. Use a rubber spatula or a paper towel (which you’ll discard immediately) to remove the majority of the residue. This step significantly reduces the bacterial load you’ll be dealing with during the washing phase.  Don't rinse the dishes yet; rinsing can actually spread bacteria around.  Think of this as the initial containment step, minimizing the spread of potential contaminants.

## Step 2: Washing Dishes in Hot, Soapy Water

Now it’s time to wash! Fill your sink with the hottest water your hands can comfortably tolerate. Add a generous amount of dish soap – more than you would typically use for everyday dishes.  The combination of hot water and soap helps to break down fats and lift away bacteria. Scrub each dish thoroughly with a clean sponge or dishcloth, paying close attention to areas that directly touched the raw chicken.  Remember to change the water frequently, especially if you’re washing a large batch of dishes.  A clean sponge is vital; consider using a new one for this task.

## Step 3: Sanitizing to Kill Remaining Bacteria

Washing with soap and water removes a lot of bacteria, but it doesn’t eliminate *all* of it. Sanitizing is the crucial step that kills the remaining harmful microorganisms. You have a couple of effective options here.  

### Bleach Solution Sanitization

Mix 1 tablespoon of unscented liquid chlorine bleach with 1 gallon of cool water. Submerge the washed dishes in this solution for at least one minute.  Ensure the dishes are fully submerged for proper sanitization. After soaking, *do not* rinse the dishes with water; allow them to air dry.  Bleach is a powerful disinfectant, but it’s important to use the correct dilution to avoid damaging your dishes or posing a health risk.

### Dishwasher Sanitization

If you have a dishwasher with a sanitize cycle, this is an excellent option. Load the washed dishes into the dishwasher and run a hot water cycle with the sanitize setting activated. The high temperatures of the sanitize cycle effectively kill bacteria.  Make sure your dishwasher is functioning properly for optimal results.

## Step 4: Air Drying – Preventing Recontamination

After sanitizing, the final step is to allow the dishes to air dry completely.  Do *not* use a dish towel, as towels can harbor bacteria and recontaminate the clean dishes.  Place the dishes on a clean drying rack and let them air dry thoroughly.  Air drying ensures that any remaining moisture doesn’t provide a breeding ground for bacteria.  Proper air circulation speeds up the drying process.

## Cleaning Your Sink and Surrounding Areas

Don’t forget about the sink and surrounding areas! After washing the dishes, thoroughly clean and sanitize your sink with a bleach solution or a disinfectant cleaner.  Wipe down countertops, faucets, and any other surfaces that may have come into contact with raw chicken or dishwater.  This prevents the spread of bacteria to other parts of your kitchen.  Consider using disposable paper towels for cleaning up spills and messes.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Q: Is it okay to wash dishes that touched raw chicken with other dishes?**
A: No, it’s best to wash dishes that touched raw chicken separately from other dishes to prevent cross-contamination. Wash them last, after all other dishes are clean.

**Q: What if I don’t have a dishwasher with a sanitize cycle?**
A: You can effectively sanitize dishes using a bleach solution as described in Step 3.

**Q: Should I wear gloves when cleaning dishes that touched raw chicken?**
A: Wearing gloves is a good practice to protect your hands from potential contamination.
