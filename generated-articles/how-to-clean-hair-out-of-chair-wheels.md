Gently insert the hook under the wrapped hair and carefully pull it away from the axle. The seam ripper’s precision allows you to target stubborn strands without damaging the wheel.

## Method 3: Deep Cleaning – Disassembling the Wheels

For heavily impacted hair, a more thorough cleaning is required. This involves disassembling the wheels from the chair base. First, carefully turn the chair over and locate the screws or clips holding the wheels in place. Use a screwdriver to remove the screws, or gently pry the wheels off if they are clipped in. Once the wheels are removed, you’ll have better access to the axle and internal components. Use a small brush, like an old toothbrush, to scrub away any remaining hair.  Pay attention to the bearings and ensure they are free of debris.  Reassemble the wheels once they are completely clean.
