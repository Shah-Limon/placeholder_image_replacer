Cleaning escarole is surprisingly easy, and this guide will walk you through everything you need to know. We’ll cover how to properly wash this slightly bitter green, ensuring you get the most flavor and texture from it.  Properly cleaned escarole elevates any salad or cooked dish, and we’ll show you how to do it right.

**Takeaway:**

**Quick Answer:** To clean escarole, remove outer leaves, separate the rest, and rinse thoroughly in cold water, checking for any lingering dirt. Dry completely using a salad spinner or paper towels before using in your favorite recipes.

## Why Cleaning Escarole is Important

Escarole, a member of the chicory family, often harbors dirt and grit between its tightly packed leaves.  It grows close to the ground, making it prone to picking up soil during cultivation.  Thorough cleaning removes these impurities, preventing a gritty texture in your salads or cooked dishes.  Beyond dirt, washing also helps remove any potential pesticides or residues that may be present.  Taking the time to clean your escarole ensures a fresh, enjoyable eating experience.

## Step-by-Step: How to Wash Escarole

Let's get into the practical steps of cleaning escarole. This process is straightforward and won't take long.

1.  **Remove Outer Leaves:** Begin by discarding any wilted or damaged outer leaves. These are often the dirtiest and won’t contribute much to the flavor.
2.  **Separate the Leaves:** Gently separate the leaves from the core. You can do this by hand, working your way around the head.
3.  **Initial Rinse:** Place the separated leaves in a large bowl filled with cold water. Swish them around to loosen any visible dirt.
4.  **Inspect and Repeat:** Lift the leaves out of the water, leaving the dirt behind. Inspect each leaf and repeat the rinsing process 2-3 times, or until the water runs clear.
5.  **Final Rinse:** Give the leaves a final rinse under cold running water to ensure all dirt is removed.

## Dealing with the Core of the Escarole

The core of the escarole is tougher and more fibrous than the leaves.  You can either discard it entirely or use it in certain recipes.  If you plan to use the core, trim away the very bottom, which is usually quite hard.  Then, you can thinly slice or chop it and add it to soups or stews where a longer cooking time will soften it.  Remember, the core has a more pronounced bitter flavor, so use it sparingly.

## Drying Escarole for Optimal Results

Properly drying escarole is crucial for several reasons. Wet leaves can become slimy and won't hold dressing well in salads.  Moisture also encourages spoilage, shortening the shelf life of your greens.  The best way to dry escarole is with a salad spinner. Spin the leaves until most of the water is removed.  If you don't have a salad spinner, spread the leaves out on clean kitchen towels or paper towels and gently pat them dry.  Allow them to air dry for a few minutes to ensure they are completely dry.

## Storing Cleaned Escarole to Maintain Freshness

Once your escarole is clean and dry, proper storage will keep it fresh for several days.  Wrap the leaves loosely in paper towels to absorb any remaining moisture.  Place the wrapped escarole in a plastic bag or airtight container.  Store it in the crisper drawer of your refrigerator.  Properly stored escarole should stay fresh for 3-5 days.  Keeping your refrigerator clean is also important; you can find tips on [how to clean the refrigerator](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bathroom) to maintain a healthy food storage environment.

## Escarole Varieties and Cleaning Considerations

While the cleaning process is generally the same for all escarole varieties, there are a few things to keep in mind. Broad-leafed escarole tends to trap more dirt, so it may require a more thorough rinsing.  Curled escarole, with its frilly leaves, can be a bit more challenging to dry completely.  Pay extra attention to the crevices when drying this variety.  Regardless of the variety, always inspect the leaves carefully for any signs of damage or pests before cleaning.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Cleaning Escarole

**Q: Can I use vinegar to clean escarole?**

**Q: How do I know if escarole has gone bad?**

A: Signs of spoilage include wilting, slimy leaves, and a strong, unpleasant odor. Discard any escarole that exhibits these characteristics.

**Q: Can I clean escarole ahead of time?**

A: Yes, you can clean escarole a day or two in advance. Just make sure it's completely dry before storing it in the refrigerator.

**Q: Is it necessary to remove the white base of the leaves?**

A: Not necessarily, but the white base can be more bitter. You can remove it if you prefer a milder flavor.

**Q: What can I do with leftover escarole stems?**

A: Don't throw them away! Escarole stems can be chopped and added to soups, stews, or stir-fries. They add a slightly bitter flavor and a nice texture.
