## Keeping the Shine: How to Clean Your Drybar Double Shot

Is your Drybar Double Shot not heating up as quickly, or leaving residue on your hair? A dirty styling iron can impact performance and even damage your hair. Cleaning your Drybar Double Shot regularly is essential for maintaining its effectiveness and extending its lifespan. This article will walk you through a simple, step-by-step process to safely and effectively clean your beloved styling tool. We’ll cover everything from cooling down to removing product buildup, ensuring you get the most out of your investment.

**Takeaway:**

*   Unplug and cool your Double Shot completely before cleaning.
*   Use a damp (not wet!) cloth with a mild cleanser to wipe the plates.
*   Avoid getting water inside the tool.
*   Regular cleaning prevents buildup and ensures optimal performance.

**Quick Answer:** To clean your Drybar Double Shot, unplug it and let it cool completely. Then, dampen a soft cloth with water and a tiny amount of mild dish soap. Gently wipe the plates to remove product residue, ensuring no water enters the tool. Dry thoroughly before storing.

## Why Cleaning Your Drybar Double Shot Matters

You likely invested in a Drybar Double Shot for professional-quality styling at home. To keep it performing like the day you bought it, regular cleaning is key. Product buildup – hairspray, serums, waxes, and even your own natural oils – accumulates on the plates with each use. This buildup can create a barrier, preventing even heat distribution and leading to inconsistent curls or straightening.  A clean Double Shot heats up faster, glides more smoothly, and delivers better results. Plus, removing residue prevents it from burning onto the plates, which is much harder to remove later.

## Gathering Your Cleaning Supplies

Before you begin, gather everything you’ll need to make the process quick and easy. You won’t need any harsh chemicals or specialized tools. Here’s a checklist:

*   **Soft Cloths:** Microfiber cloths are ideal, as they are gentle and absorbent.
*   **Mild Dish Soap:** A small amount is all you need. Avoid abrasive cleaners.
*   **Water:** Use distilled water if possible, to avoid mineral deposits.
*   **Cotton Swabs:** For cleaning hard-to-reach areas around the plates.
*   **Old Toothbrush (Optional):** For stubborn buildup.

Having these items readily available will streamline the cleaning process and ensure you don’t have to interrupt your routine.



## Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Your Double Shot

Now, let's get to the cleaning process. Remember, safety first! Always unplug your Double Shot and allow it to cool completely before you start. 

1.  **Unplug and Cool:** This is the most important step. Never attempt to clean a hot styling tool.
2.  **Dampen the Cloth:** Lightly dampen a soft cloth with water and add a tiny drop of mild dish soap. Wring out the cloth thoroughly – it should be damp, *not* wet.
3.  **Wipe the Plates:** Gently wipe the plates of the Double Shot with the damp cloth. Use a back-and-forth motion to remove product buildup.
4.  **Clean Hard-to-Reach Areas:** Use a cotton swab dipped in the soapy water to clean around the edges of the plates and any crevices. An old toothbrush can also be helpful for stubborn residue.
5.  **Dry Thoroughly:** Use a clean, dry cloth to wipe away any remaining moisture. Ensure the plates are completely dry before storing or using the Double Shot.  You can also let it air dry for a few minutes.

## Dealing with Stubborn Product Buildup

Sometimes, despite regular cleaning, stubborn product buildup can persist. Don’t worry, there are a few things you can try. First, let the damp cloth sit on the buildup for a minute or two to help loosen it.  If that doesn’t work, try using a slightly more concentrated solution of dish soap and water.  Avoid using abrasive cleaners, as they can scratch the plates.  For particularly tough buildup, consider a specialized hair tool cleaner, but always test it on a small, inconspicuous area first.

## Preventing Future Buildup: Best Practices

Preventing buildup is easier than removing it! Here are a few tips to keep your Drybar Double Shot clean and performing optimally:

*   **Clean After Each Use:**  A quick wipe-down after each use will prevent buildup from accumulating.
*   **Use Products Sparingly:**  Avoid applying excessive amounts of hair products.
*   **Cool Before Storage:**  Always allow the Double Shot to cool completely before storing it.
*   **Store Properly:** Store your Double Shot in a cool, dry place, away from moisture and dust.
*   **Regular Deep Cleans:** Incorporate a more thorough cleaning session (like the one described above) every month or so, depending on how frequently you use the tool.

## Troubleshooting: What to Do If Your Double Shot Still Isn't Working

If you’ve cleaned your Drybar Double Shot and it’s still not heating up properly or performing as expected, there may be a more serious issue. Check the power cord for any damage. If the cord is frayed or damaged, do not use the tool.  If the problem persists, contact Drybar customer support for assistance.  Attempting to repair the tool yourself could void the warranty and potentially be dangerous.  You might also want to consider checking if the issue is related to the power outlet, similar to troubleshooting issues with [how to clean a boat](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-boat) where power sources need to be verified.
