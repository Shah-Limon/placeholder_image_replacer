## Cleaning Grease Made Easy: How to Use Cornstarch

Ever stared at a greasy mess and wondered if there was an easier way to clean it up than scrubbing for hours? You’re in luck! Cleaning grease with cornstarch is a surprisingly effective and natural method. It might sound strange, but this pantry staple is a fantastic absorbent, making it perfect for tackling those stubborn grease stains and spills. This article will guide you through everything you need to know about using cornstarch to conquer grease, from kitchen counters to clothing.

**Takeaway:**

*   Cornstarch absorbs grease, making cleanup easier.
*   It’s a natural, non-toxic alternative to harsh chemicals.
*   This method works on various surfaces, including fabrics and hard surfaces.

**Can cornstarch really clean grease?**

Yes! Cornstarch is a powder that readily absorbs oil and grease. When applied to a greasy surface, it draws the oil out, making it easier to wipe or vacuum away. It’s a safe and effective alternative to chemical cleaners, especially for delicate surfaces.

## Why Cornstarch Works on Grease

Cornstarch is made up of tiny granules that have a large surface area. This allows it to act like a sponge, soaking up the grease instead of spreading it around. It’s a completely natural solution, making it a great choice for those who prefer to avoid harsh chemicals in their homes. Plus, it’s incredibly affordable and readily available in most kitchens. You likely already have what you need to get started! This makes it a convenient option when you need a quick and easy grease-fighting solution.

## How to Clean Grease From Surfaces with Cornstarch

Let's dive into the practical application. Cleaning grease with cornstarch is a straightforward process. First, generously cover the greasy area with a thick layer of cornstarch. Let it sit for at least 15-30 minutes, or even longer for stubborn grease. The longer it sits, the more grease it will absorb. After the waiting period, simply sweep or vacuum up the cornstarch, taking the grease with it. For remaining residue, a damp cloth can be used to wipe the surface clean. 

## Tackling Grease on Different Materials

The beauty of using cornstarch is its versatility. However, the application method might vary slightly depending on the surface you’re cleaning.

### Cleaning Grease From Fabrics & Carpets

Grease stains on clothing or carpets can be frustrating. Fortunately, cornstarch can help! Sprinkle a generous amount of cornstarch onto the stain and gently rub it in. Let it sit for several hours, or even overnight, to fully absorb the grease. Then, vacuum up the cornstarch. If any stain remains, repeat the process or consider using a mild detergent.

### Cleaning Grease From Hard Surfaces (Counters, Floors)

For kitchen counters, stovetops, or floors, the process is similar. Sprinkle cornstarch over the greasy area and let it sit for 15-30 minutes. Then, sweep or vacuum up the cornstarch. Wipe the surface with a damp cloth to remove any remaining residue. For baked-on grease, you might need to let the cornstarch sit for a longer period or use a bit of gentle scrubbing.

### Cleaning Grease From Glass

Cornstarch can even be used on glass surfaces! Apply a thin layer of cornstarch to the greasy glass, let it sit for a few minutes, and then wipe it away with a soft cloth. This will help to remove the grease without leaving streaks. For frosted glass, be extra gentle to avoid scratching the surface.

## Preventing Grease Splatters & Future Messes

While cornstarch is great for cleaning up grease, preventing splatters in the first place is even better. When cooking, use a splatter screen to contain oil and grease. Regularly clean your stovetop and kitchen surfaces to prevent grease buildup. Consider using baking sheets with raised edges to catch drips and spills. A little prevention can save you a lot of cleaning time in the long run.

## Cornstarch vs. Other Grease Cleaning Methods

Compared to traditional grease cleaners, cornstarch offers several advantages. It’s non-toxic, environmentally friendly, and safe for use around children and pets. Unlike harsh chemicals, it won’t damage surfaces or release harmful fumes. While commercial degreasers can be effective, they often come with a strong odor and require careful handling. Cornstarch provides a gentle yet powerful alternative.
