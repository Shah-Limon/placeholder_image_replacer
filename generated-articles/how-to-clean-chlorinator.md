## Keeping Your Pool Sanitized: How to Clean a Chlorinator

Is your pool water looking a little cloudy, even after adding chemicals? A dirty chlorinator could be the culprit. A chlorinator, whether salt-based or using chlorine tablets, is the heart of your pool’s sanitation system. Learning [how to clean the pool](https://beacleaner.com/how-often-to-clean-the-pool) and specifically, how to clean your chlorinator, is vital for maintaining a healthy and enjoyable swimming environment. This article will walk you through the process, step-by-step, ensuring your chlorinator functions efficiently and extends its lifespan. We’ll cover different types of chlorinators, cleaning solutions, and preventative measures.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly inspect your chlorinator for scale buildup.
*   Turn off the power before any cleaning procedure.
*   Use a mild acid solution for effective cleaning.
*   Rinse thoroughly after cleaning to remove all residue.

**What Does a Chlorinator Do, and Why Clean It?**

A chlorinator’s job is to consistently release sanitizer into your pool water. Salt chlorinators convert salt into chlorine through electrolysis, while traditional chlorinators dissolve chlorine tablets or granules. Over time, mineral buildup, particularly calcium scale, can accumulate inside the chlorinator cell or chamber. This buildup reduces the efficiency of chlorine production, forcing you to use more chemicals and potentially leading to algae growth. Cleaning your chlorinator restores its performance and saves you money in the long run.

## Identifying Your Chlorinator Type

Before you begin, it’s important to know what type of chlorinator you have. Different types require slightly different cleaning methods. The two main types are:

*   **Salt Chlorinators:** These use a cell with titanium plates to convert salt into chlorine. They are very popular due to their convenience and consistent chlorine production.
*   **Chlorine Tablet/Granule Feeders:** These use a floating basket or in-line system to slowly release chlorine into the water. These are generally simpler in design.

Knowing your chlorinator type will help you choose the right cleaning solution and procedure. If you're unsure, consult your owner's manual.

## Safety First: Preparing to Clean Your Chlorinator

Safety is paramount when working with electrical equipment and chemicals. Always follow these precautions:

1.  **Turn Off the Power:** Completely disconnect the power supply to the chlorinator at the circuit breaker. This prevents electrical shock.
2.  **Wear Protective Gear:** Wear gloves and eye protection to shield your skin and eyes from cleaning solutions.
3.  **Read the Manual:** Refer to your chlorinator’s owner’s manual for specific instructions and warnings.
4.  **Work in a Well-Ventilated Area:** If using cleaning solutions, ensure adequate ventilation to avoid inhaling fumes.

Taking these steps will ensure a safe and successful cleaning process.

## Cleaning a Salt Chlorinator Cell

Salt chlorinators require regular cleaning to remove calcium scale buildup on the titanium plates. Here’s how to do it:

1.  **Remove the Cell:** After turning off the power, carefully remove the cell from the chlorinator housing.
2.  **Inspect the Plates:** Examine the plates for visible scale buildup.
3.  **Prepare a Cleaning Solution:** Mix a solution of muriatic acid (hydrochloric acid) and water. *Always add acid to water, never water to acid.* A common ratio is 1 part acid to 5-10 parts water.
4.  **Soak the Cell:** Submerge the cell in the acid solution, ensuring all plates are covered. Soak for 15-30 minutes, or until the scale dissolves. *Do not soak for extended periods, as this can damage the plates.*
5.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Remove the cell and rinse it thoroughly with clean water until all traces of acid are gone.
6.  **Reinstall the Cell:** Carefully reinstall the cell into the chlorinator housing and restore power.

Regular cleaning, perhaps every 3-6 months, will keep your salt chlorinator operating at peak efficiency. You might also consider [how to clean aluminum](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-aluminum) if your chlorinator housing is made of this material.

## Cleaning a Chlorine Tablet/Granule Feeder

Cleaning a chlorine tablet or granule feeder is generally simpler than cleaning a salt cell. Here’s the process:

1.  **Empty the Feeder:** Remove any remaining chlorine tablets or granules from the feeder.
2.  **Disassemble the Feeder:** Disassemble the feeder according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
3.  **Clean with Mild Soap and Water:** Wash all parts of the feeder with mild soap and water to remove any residue.
4.  **Inspect for Cracks or Damage:** Check for any cracks or damage to the feeder. Replace any damaged parts.
5.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Rinse all parts thoroughly with clean water.
6.  **Reassemble the Feeder:** Reassemble the feeder and refill with chlorine tablets or granules.

This type of chlorinator should be cleaned at least once a season, or more frequently if you notice a buildup of residue.

## Preventing Chlorinator Buildup

Prevention is always better than cure. Here are some tips to minimize scale buildup in your chlorinator:

*   **Maintain Proper Water Chemistry:** Keep your pool water balanced, with the correct pH, alkalinity, and calcium hardness levels.
*   **Regularly Brush and Vacuum:** Regularly brush and vacuum your pool to remove debris that can contribute to scale formation.
*   **Use a Scale Inhibitor:** Consider using a scale inhibitor product to help prevent calcium buildup.
*   **Monitor Salt Levels (for Salt Chlorinators):** Ensure your salt levels are within the recommended range for your salt chlorinator.
*   **Consider a Pre-Filter:** Installing a pre-filter can help remove debris before it reaches the chlorinator.

Taking these preventative measures will significantly reduce the frequency of cleaning and extend the life of your chlorinator. Maintaining a clean pool also means regularly checking [how often to clean the pool filter](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-often-should-you-clean-the-pool-filter).

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

*   **How often should I clean my chlorinator?**  Salt chlorinators typically need cleaning every 3-6 months, while tablet/granule feeders should be cleaned at least once a season. Frequency depends on water hardness and usage.
*   **Can I use vinegar to clean my chlorinator?** While vinegar can dissolve some scale, it’s not as effective as muriatic acid and may take longer.
*   **Is it safe to handle muriatic acid?** Muriatic acid is corrosive. Always wear gloves and eye protection, and add acid to water, not water to acid.
*   **What if the scale is very stubborn?** You may need to increase the concentration of the acid solution or extend the soaking time, but be careful not to damage the cell.
*   **Can I clean my chlorinator with a pressure washer?** No, a pressure washer can damage the cell or feeder.
*   **What should I do if my chlorinator is still not working after cleaning?** Consult a qualified pool technician to diagnose and repair the problem.

## Conclusion

Cleaning your chlorinator is a crucial part of pool maintenance. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can ensure your chlorinator operates efficiently, providing clean and sanitized water for years to come. Remember to prioritize safety, identify your chlorinator type, and maintain proper water chemistry. A little preventative maintenance goes a long way in keeping your pool sparkling and enjoyable. Don’t hesitate to seek professional help if you encounter any difficulties. Keeping your pool clean is a rewarding experience, and a well-maintained chlorinator is key to achieving that goal.
