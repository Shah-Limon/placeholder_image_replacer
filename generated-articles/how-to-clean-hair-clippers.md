## Keeping Your Clippers Sharp: How to Clean Hair Clippers

Have you ever wondered how to keep your hair clippers running smoothly and hygienically? Dirty hair clippers can lead to poor performance, dull blades, and even the spread of bacteria. Cleaning your hair clippers regularly isn’t just about maintaining their cutting power; it’s also about ensuring good hygiene for yourself and anyone else you’re grooming. This article will walk you through a step-by-step guide on how to clean hair clippers, ensuring they stay in top condition for years to come. We’ll cover everything from daily maintenance to deep cleaning, so you can always achieve a professional-quality haircut.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly remove hair debris after each use.
*   Disinfect blades after every haircut to prevent bacteria spread.
*   Oil the blades to maintain sharpness and smooth operation.
*   Deep clean your clippers monthly for optimal performance.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean hair clippers, first unplug them. Remove hair with a brush, then disinfect the blades with a cleaning spray or rubbing alcohol. Oil the blades, and wipe down the clipper body. Regular cleaning ensures hygiene and extends the life of your clippers.

## Why Cleaning Your Hair Clippers Matters

Cleaning your hair clippers is more important than you might think. Hair, skin cells, and product buildup can quickly accumulate, hindering performance and creating a breeding ground for bacteria. This buildup can cause the blades to drag, leading to uneven cuts and discomfort.  Regular cleaning prevents this, ensuring a smooth and efficient cutting experience. Plus, maintaining clean clippers is essential for preventing the spread of infections, especially when sharing them with others. 

## Daily Maintenance: Quick Clean After Every Use

After each haircut, a quick clean is essential. This doesn’t require a lot of time, but it makes a huge difference in the long run. Start by unplugging the clippers to ensure safety. Then, use the small brush that usually comes with your clippers to remove any visible hair from the blades and the clipper body.  Pay close attention to the teeth of the blades, as hair tends to get stuck in those areas.  For a more thorough daily clean, consider using a dedicated clipper cleaning spray – you can find more information on [how to clean clippers with alcohol](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-clippers-with-alcohol) for effective disinfection.

## Deep Cleaning Your Hair Clippers: A Monthly Routine

While daily maintenance keeps things tidy, a deep clean is necessary at least once a month. This involves a more thorough disinfection and lubrication process. Begin by unplugging the clippers and removing the blade. Many clippers have detachable blades, making cleaning easier.  Next, use a clipper cleaning spray or isopropyl alcohol to thoroughly disinfect the blade. Allow the blade to dry completely before proceeding.  

### Disinfecting the Blades

Disinfecting the blades is a crucial step in preventing the spread of bacteria and ensuring hygiene.  Spray the blade with a clipper disinfectant or 70% isopropyl alcohol. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes to allow the disinfectant to kill any germs.  Afterward, wipe the blade clean with a soft cloth.  If you're a professional barber, disinfecting after *every* client is a must.

### Lubricating the Blades

After disinfecting and drying, lubrication is key to maintaining blade sharpness and smooth operation. Apply a few drops of clipper oil along the sides of the blade. Turn the clippers on for a few seconds to distribute the oil evenly. Wipe away any excess oil with a clean cloth. Proper lubrication reduces friction and extends the life of your blades.

## Cleaning the Clipper Body

Don't forget about the clipper body! The exterior can accumulate hair, skin cells, and product residue. Use a soft cloth dampened with a mild cleaning solution to wipe down the body of the clippers. Avoid getting any liquid inside the clipper housing. Pay attention to the areas around the power button and the adjustment lever.  A clean exterior not only looks better but also helps prevent the buildup of grime that can affect performance.

## Storing Your Clean Clippers Properly

Proper storage is just as important as cleaning.  Store your clippers in a clean, dry place, away from dust and moisture. A dedicated clipper case is ideal, but a drawer or cabinet will also work.  Make sure the blades are lightly oiled before storing to prevent rust.  Avoid storing clippers with rubber bands or other materials that could damage the blades or housing.  

## Troubleshooting Common Clipper Cleaning Issues

Sometimes, even with regular cleaning, you might encounter issues. If your clippers are still cutting poorly after cleaning, the blades may be dull and need sharpening or replacing.  If the clippers are overheating, there may be a buildup of hair inside the motor housing – in this case, professional servicing might be required.  If you notice a strange smell, it could indicate a problem with the motor or internal components.
