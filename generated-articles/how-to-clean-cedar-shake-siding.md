## Keeping Your Home Beautiful: How to Clean Cedar Shake Siding

Is your cedar shake siding looking a little dull? Over time, exposure to the elements can cause dirt, algae, and mildew to build up, diminishing your home’s curb appeal. Cleaning cedar shake siding isn’t difficult, but it does require a gentle approach to avoid damage. This article will guide you through the process of safely and effectively cleaning your cedar shake siding, restoring its natural beauty and protecting your investment. We’ll cover everything from choosing the right cleaning solutions to preventative maintenance tips.

**Takeaway:**

*   Use a gentle cleaning solution specifically designed for wood.
*   Avoid high-pressure washing, which can damage the wood.
*   Rinse thoroughly and allow the siding to dry completely.
*   Apply a wood preservative or sealant to protect the siding.

**Quick Answer:** To clean cedar shake siding, gently scrub with a solution of water and mild detergent (or a specialized wood cleaner), avoiding high pressure. Rinse thoroughly and allow to dry, then consider applying a wood preservative to protect it from future damage.

## Understanding Cedar Shake Siding & Cleaning Needs

Cedar shake siding is a beautiful and durable option for home exteriors. However, its natural wood composition means it’s susceptible to organic growth and weathering. Regular cleaning is essential to prevent these issues from becoming severe. Unlike vinyl or aluminum siding, cedar requires a more delicate touch. Harsh chemicals and high-pressure washing can cause splitting, warping, and damage to the wood fibers. Understanding these nuances is the first step towards effective cedar shake siding maintenance. 

## Choosing the Right Cleaning Solution for Cedar Shake

Selecting the appropriate cleaning solution is crucial for preserving your cedar shake siding. Avoid harsh chemicals like bleach, as they can discolor the wood and harm surrounding plants. Instead, opt for a gentle wood cleaner specifically formulated for exterior use. A mixture of warm water and mild dish soap can also be effective for light cleaning. For stubborn mildew or algae, consider a solution of water and oxygen bleach, following the manufacturer’s instructions carefully. Remember to always test any cleaning solution in an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn’t cause discoloration or damage.

## The Gentle Cleaning Process: Step-by-Step Guide

Now, let's get into the actual cleaning process. Start by preparing the area by covering plants and shrubs with plastic sheeting to protect them from the cleaning solution. Next, wet the siding with a garden hose. Apply your chosen cleaning solution using a soft-bristled brush or a sponge, working in sections. Gently scrub the siding, following the grain of the wood. Avoid excessive pressure, as this can damage the shakes. Rinse thoroughly with a garden hose, ensuring all traces of the cleaning solution are removed. Finally, allow the siding to dry completely before applying any protective coatings.

### Avoiding Common Mistakes During Cleaning

Several common mistakes can damage your cedar shake siding during cleaning. Using a pressure washer is a major one – the high pressure can force water behind the shakes, leading to rot and mold growth. Another mistake is using abrasive cleaners or scrub brushes, which can scratch and damage the wood surface. Failing to test the cleaning solution beforehand can also lead to unexpected discoloration. Lastly, neglecting to rinse thoroughly can leave residue that attracts dirt and promotes mildew growth.

## Dealing with Stubborn Stains on Cedar Shake

Sometimes, gentle cleaning isn’t enough to remove stubborn stains like bird droppings or shingle marks. For bird droppings, gently scrape off any solid material with a plastic scraper, then clean the area with a solution of warm water and mild detergent. If you're struggling with shingle marks, you might find helpful information on [how to clean shingle marks off siding](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-shingle-marks-off-siding). For more persistent stains, consider using a specialized wood stain remover, following the manufacturer’s instructions carefully. Remember to always test the remover in an inconspicuous area first.

## Protecting Your Cedar Shake Siding: Sealants & Preservatives

After cleaning, protecting your cedar shake siding is essential for long-term durability. Applying a wood preservative or sealant helps to repel water, prevent mildew growth, and protect the wood from UV damage. Choose a sealant specifically designed for cedar shake siding, and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for application. Reapply the sealant every few years, or as needed, to maintain optimal protection. Regular maintenance, like cleaning your windows [how often to clean windows](https://beacleaner.com/how-often-to-clean-windows), can also contribute to the overall health of your home's exterior.

## Preventative Maintenance for Long-Lasting Beauty

Preventative maintenance is key to keeping your cedar shake siding looking its best for years to come. Regularly inspect the siding for any signs of damage, such as cracks, splits, or loose shakes. Trim any trees or shrubs that are touching the siding, as this can trap moisture and promote mildew growth. Clean gutters regularly to prevent water from overflowing and damaging the siding. By taking these simple steps, you can significantly extend the life of your cedar shake siding and maintain your home’s curb appeal.
