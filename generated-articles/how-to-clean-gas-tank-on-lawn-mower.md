## Keeping Your Mower Running: How To Clean A Gas Tank On A Lawn Mower

Is your lawn mower struggling to start, running rough, or leaving behind a trail of smoke? Often, the culprit isn’t a major engine problem, but a dirty gas tank. Old, stale gasoline can leave behind varnish and sediment that clog fuel lines and carburetors. Cleaning your lawn mower’s gas tank is a simple maintenance task that can save you from costly repairs and get you back to enjoying a perfectly manicured lawn. This guide will walk you through the process, step-by-step.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly cleaning your lawn mower gas tank prevents clogs.
*   Old gas degrades and can damage your engine.
*   Proper cleaning ensures optimal performance and extends the life of your mower.

**Quick Answer:** Cleaning a lawn mower gas tank involves draining the old fuel, rinsing the tank with fresh gasoline, and using a tank cleaner if necessary.  Always disconnect the spark plug before starting and work in a well-ventilated area.

## Why Cleaning Your Lawn Mower Gas Tank Matters

Let's face it, nobody enjoys lawn work when the equipment isn't cooperating.  Old gasoline breaks down over time, forming gum and varnish deposits. These deposits can restrict fuel flow, causing starting problems, reduced power, and even engine damage.  Regularly cleaning your gas tank prevents these issues and ensures your lawn mower runs efficiently.  Think of it as preventative medicine for your mower!

*   **Prevents Clogging:**  Sediment and varnish build-up can clog the fuel filter and carburetor.
*   **Improves Performance:** A clean fuel system ensures optimal fuel delivery for smooth operation.
*   **Extends Engine Life:**  Avoiding fuel-related issues protects your engine from premature wear and tear.
*   **Saves Money:**  Preventative maintenance is far cheaper than major repairs or engine replacement.

## Gathering Your Supplies for Gas Tank Cleaning

Before you begin, it’s important to have everything you need on hand. This will make the process smoother and more efficient. You don’t want to be running to the store mid-cleaning!  Here’s a checklist of the essential supplies:

*   **Fuel Stabilizer:**  For preventing future fuel degradation.
*   **Gas Tank Cleaner:** Specifically designed for small engines. [https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-boat-gas-tank](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-boat-gas-tank) offers a similar process for other fuel tanks.
*   **Fresh Gasoline:** For rinsing the tank.
*   **Drain Pan:** To safely collect the old gasoline.
*   **Funnel:** For pouring liquids.
*   **Screwdriver or Wrench:** To disconnect the spark plug.
*   **Gloves & Safety Glasses:** For protection.
*   **Rags:** For cleaning up spills.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Your Lawn Mower Gas Tank

Now that you have your supplies, let's get started! Remember safety first – always disconnect the spark plug wire before working on the fuel system. This prevents accidental starting.  Follow these steps for a thorough cleaning:

1.  **Disconnect the Spark Plug:** Locate the spark plug and carefully disconnect the wire.
2.  **Drain the Old Fuel:** Use a siphon pump or carefully tilt the mower to drain the old gasoline into your drain pan. Dispose of the old fuel properly at a hazardous waste collection site.
3.  **Rinse with Fresh Gasoline:** Pour a small amount of fresh gasoline into the tank, swirl it around to loosen any remaining deposits, and then drain it into the pan. Repeat this process until the rinse comes out clear.
4.  **Add Gas Tank Cleaner (If Needed):** If the tank still appears dirty, add a gas tank cleaner according to the manufacturer's instructions. Let it sit for the recommended time.
5.  **Final Rinse:** After the cleaner has sat, rinse the tank thoroughly with fresh gasoline to remove any remaining cleaner residue.
6.  **Inspect and Reassemble:**  Visually inspect the tank for any remaining debris. Reconnect the spark plug wire.

## Dealing with Stubborn Deposits and Rust

Sometimes, old gas leaves behind particularly stubborn deposits or even rust inside the tank. Don't worry, there are ways to tackle these issues.  A little extra effort can make a big difference.

*   **Vinegar Solution:** For light rust, try filling the tank with a 50/50 mixture of white vinegar and water. Let it sit overnight, then drain and rinse thoroughly with gasoline.

*   **Commercial Rust Remover:** For heavier rust, use a commercial rust remover specifically designed for fuel tanks. Follow the product instructions carefully.
*   **Tank Cleaning Tablets:** These tablets dissolve in gasoline and help break down deposits and rust.
*   **Consider a Carburetor Clean:** If the deposits were significant, it's a good idea to also clean the carburetor. [https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-carburetor-on-push-mower](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-carburetor-on-push-mower) can guide you through that process.

## Preventing Future Gas Tank Issues

Cleaning your gas tank is a great start, but preventing future problems is even better. A little proactive maintenance can save you a lot of headaches down the road.  Here are a few tips:

*   **Use Fuel Stabilizer:** Add fuel stabilizer to your gasoline, especially if you're storing the mower for an extended period.
*   **Drain Fuel Before Storage:**  Before storing your mower for the winter, drain the gas tank completely.
*   **Use Fresh Gasoline:**  Avoid using gasoline that has been sitting for more than 30 days.
*   **Store in a Cool, Dry Place:**  Store your mower in a cool, dry place to prevent fuel degradation.
*   **Regularly Check the Fuel Filter:** A clogged fuel filter can contribute to fuel system problems.
