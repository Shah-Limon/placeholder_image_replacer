## Keeping Your Laundry Fresh: How To Clean A Frigidaire Washing Machine

Is your laundry not smelling as fresh as it should? A dirty washing machine could be the culprit! Many people forget that washing machines themselves need regular cleaning. This article will guide you through how to clean a Frigidaire washing machine, ensuring your clothes come out sparkling and smelling their best. We’ll cover everything from cleaning the dispenser to tackling the drum and exterior. Let’s get started on restoring your Frigidaire washer to its prime condition.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning prevents mold and mildew growth.
*   Using the correct cleaning agents protects your machine.
*   A clean washer means cleaner, fresher laundry.

**Quick Answer:** To clean a Frigidaire washing machine, wipe down the exterior, clean the dispenser drawer, run a cleaning cycle with hot water and washing machine cleaner (or vinegar/baking soda), and wipe the rubber gasket. Repeat this process monthly for optimal results.

## Why Cleaning Your Frigidaire Washing Machine Matters

Think about everything your washing machine handles – dirt, grime, detergent residue, and more. Over time, these build up inside the machine, creating a breeding ground for mold and mildew. This can lead to unpleasant odors that transfer to your clothes. Cleaning your Frigidaire washing machine isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about hygiene and maintaining the machine’s performance. A well-maintained washer will also last longer, saving you money in the long run. 

## Cleaning the Dispenser Drawer

The dispenser drawer is often overlooked, but it’s a prime spot for residue buildup. Detergent, fabric softener, and bleach can leave sticky deposits that harbor bacteria. To clean it, first, locate the release button or lever (consult your Frigidaire washer’s manual if needed). Remove the drawer and rinse it thoroughly with warm water. Use a soft brush or cloth to scrub away any stubborn residue. For a deeper clean, soak the drawer in a solution of warm water and vinegar for about 30 minutes before rinsing.  Ensure the drawer is completely dry before reinserting it.

## Deep Cleaning the Washing Machine Drum

The drum is where the real action happens, and therefore, where the most buildup occurs. You can clean the drum using a washing machine cleaner, white vinegar, or baking soda.  Here’s how:

1.  **Using Washing Machine Cleaner:** Follow the instructions on your chosen cleaner. Typically, you’ll pour the cleaner into the dispenser and run a hot water cycle.
2.  **Using Vinegar & Baking Soda:** Pour two cups of white vinegar into the detergent dispenser. Sprinkle half a cup of baking soda directly into the drum. Run a hot water cycle on the longest setting.
3.  **Run an Extra Rinse Cycle:** After the cleaning cycle is complete, run an extra rinse cycle to ensure all traces of cleaner or vinegar/baking soda are removed.

This process helps to dissolve detergent residue, eliminate odors, and sanitize the drum.  Regular drum cleaning prevents the buildup of grime that can affect your laundry’s cleanliness.

## Addressing the Rubber Gasket & Door

The rubber gasket around the washing machine door is another area prone to mold and mildew growth. This is because moisture can get trapped in the folds of the gasket. After each wash, wipe down the gasket with a dry cloth to remove excess water. For a deeper clean, mix a solution of equal parts water and white vinegar. Dip a cloth into the solution and carefully wipe around the gasket, paying attention to all the crevices.  Leave the washing machine door slightly ajar after each use to allow the gasket to air dry.

## Cleaning the Exterior of Your Frigidaire Washer

Don’t forget the outside of your Frigidaire washing machine! Wipe down the exterior with a damp cloth and a mild cleaning solution. Avoid using abrasive cleaners, as they can scratch the surface. Pay attention to the control panel and any areas where spills may have occurred. For stainless steel exteriors, use a stainless steel cleaner to maintain its shine. A clean exterior not only looks better but also prevents the buildup of dust and grime that can contribute to odors.

## Maintaining Your Washing Machine: Preventative Measures

Cleaning your Frigidaire washing machine is important, but preventative measures can reduce the frequency of deep cleaning. Here are a few tips:

*   **Use the Correct Amount of Detergent:** Using too much detergent can lead to residue buildup. Follow the detergent manufacturer’s instructions and adjust the amount based on your load size.
*   **Leave the Door Ajar:** As mentioned earlier, leaving the door slightly open after each wash allows the machine to air out and prevents mold growth.
*   **Regularly Check the Hoses:** Inspect the water inlet and drain hoses for cracks or leaks. Replace them if necessary. [https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine-pipes](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-washing-machine-pipes)
*   **Run a Cleaning Cycle Monthly:** Make it a habit to run a cleaning cycle with a washing machine cleaner or vinegar/baking soda at least once a month.



## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How often should I clean my Frigidaire washing machine?**
A: You should aim to deep clean your Frigidaire washing machine at least once a month. Wipe down the gasket and exterior after each use, and clean the dispenser drawer weekly.

**Q: Can I use bleach to clean my washing machine?**
A: While bleach can be effective at killing mold and mildew, it can also damage some washing machine components. It’s generally safer to use washing machine cleaner, vinegar, or baking soda.

**Q: What if my washing machine still smells after cleaning?**
A: If the odor persists, repeat the cleaning cycle. You may also want to check the drain pump filter for any trapped debris.

**Q: Is it safe to mix vinegar and baking soda in the washing machine?**
A: Yes, it’s safe to use vinegar and baking soda together, but they will neutralize each other somewhat. The fizzing action can help loosen debris, but the cleaning power is slightly reduced compared to using them separately.

**Q: How do I know if my Frigidaire washing machine needs cleaning?**
A: Signs include unpleasant odors, visible mold or mildew, detergent residue, and clothes that don’t come out as clean as they should.
