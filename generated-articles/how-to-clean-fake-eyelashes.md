## Keeping Your Lashes Lush: How to Clean Fake Eyelashes

Have you ever wondered how to keep those beautiful fake eyelashes looking their best? Cleaning your fake eyelashes is crucial, not just for aesthetics, but for your eye health too. Dirty lashes can harbor bacteria, leading to irritation or even infection. This article will guide you through the simple steps to properly clean your fake eyelashes, extending their lifespan and ensuring safe, stunning looks. We’ll cover everything from removing makeup residue to disinfecting and storing your lashes correctly. 

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning extends the life of your fake eyelashes.
*   Proper cleaning prevents bacteria buildup and potential eye irritation.
*   Gentle handling is key to maintaining the lash shape and integrity.

**Quick Answer:** To clean fake eyelashes, gently remove any lash glue and makeup with an oil-free makeup remover. Then, wash them with mild shampoo and water, pat dry, and store them in a clean lash case.

## Why Cleaning Your Fake Eyelashes Matters

Let's face it, we love the instant glam fake eyelashes provide. But just like makeup brushes, they collect product buildup, glue residue, and potentially harmful bacteria. Think about it – you’re applying these close to your eyes! Regularly cleaning your fake eyelashes prevents this buildup. This not only makes them look better, but also significantly reduces the risk of eye infections and irritation.  Ignoring this step can lead to discomfort and even force you to discard perfectly good lashes prematurely.

## Gathering Your Cleaning Supplies

Before you begin, gather everything you’ll need for a thorough cleaning. You don’t need a lot, and most of these items you likely already have. Here’s a checklist:

*   **Oil-Free Makeup Remover:** Essential for dissolving mascara and lash glue. Avoid oil-based removers as they can damage the lash fibers.
*   **Mild Shampoo:** Baby shampoo works wonderfully, or any gentle, sulfate-free shampoo.
*   **Clean Spoolie:** A clean mascara wand is perfect for gently brushing the lashes.
*   **Soft Towel or Lint-Free Cloth:** For drying the lashes.
*   **Lash Case:** To store your clean lashes safely.
*   **Tweezers (Optional):** Helpful for handling delicate lashes.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Your Faux Lashes

Now, let's get down to the cleaning process. It’s easier than you think! Start by gently removing any visible makeup from the lashes.  Next, carefully wash the lashes with a mild shampoo solution. Finally, ensure they are completely dry before storing them.

1.  **Remove Makeup & Glue:** Gently use a cotton swab dipped in oil-free makeup remover to dissolve any mascara or glue residue. Be careful not to pull or tug on the lashes.
2.  **Wash with Shampoo:** Mix a tiny amount of mild shampoo with lukewarm water. Dip a clean spoolie into the solution and gently brush it along the lashes, mimicking the motion of applying mascara.
3.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** Rinse the lashes under lukewarm running water, ensuring all shampoo residue is removed.
4.  **Pat Dry:** Gently pat the lashes dry with a soft towel or lint-free cloth. Avoid rubbing, as this can damage the lash shape.
5.  **Comb & Store:** Once completely dry, use a clean spoolie to comb through the lashes, restoring their shape. Store them in a clean lash case to protect them from dust and damage.

## Disinfecting Your Fake Eyelashes

Cleaning removes visible dirt and makeup, but disinfecting takes it a step further. Disinfecting kills bacteria that can linger even after washing.  This is especially important if you wear your lashes frequently. You can use a lash disinfectant solution specifically designed for this purpose, or a diluted isopropyl alcohol solution (use with caution and ensure it's thoroughly rinsed off).  Remember, your eye health is paramount!

## Extending the Life of Your Lashes: Proper Storage

Proper storage is just as important as cleaning.  Storing your lashes correctly prevents them from getting crushed, bent, or tangled. Always store your clean, dry lashes in a dedicated lash case. This protects them from dust, dirt, and accidental damage. Avoid storing them in humid environments, as this can promote bacteria growth.  Taking care of your lashes like this will ensure you get the most wear out of them.

## How Often Should You Clean Your Fake Eyelashes?

The frequency of cleaning depends on how often you wear your lashes. As a general rule, clean your lashes *after every use*. Even if they don’t look visibly dirty, bacteria can still be present. If you wear your lashes daily, a thorough cleaning every day is essential. If you only wear them occasionally, cleaning them before each use is sufficient.  Consistent cleaning is the key to maintaining healthy, beautiful lashes.



## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use regular soap to clean my fake eyelashes?**

A: While you *can* use regular soap, it’s best to stick to mild, sulfate-free shampoos or baby shampoo. Regular soaps can be harsh and strip the lashes of their natural oils, making them brittle and prone to damage.

**Q: How do I remove stubborn lash glue?**

A: Soak a cotton swab in oil-free makeup remover and gently hold it against the glue residue for a few seconds to soften it. Then, gently wipe away the glue. Avoid pulling or tugging on the lashes.

**Q: What if my lashes lose their shape after cleaning?**

A: Gently comb through the lashes with a clean spoolie while they are still slightly damp to help restore their shape. You can also carefully use your fingers to reshape them.

**Q: Can I reuse fake eyelashes multiple times?**

A: Yes, with proper cleaning and storage, you can reuse fake eyelashes multiple times – typically 5-20 wears, depending on the quality of the lashes and how well you care for them.

Cleaning your fake eyelashes is a simple yet vital step in maintaining both their appearance and your eye health. By following these guidelines, you can extend the life of your lashes, prevent irritation, and enjoy stunning looks with confidence.
