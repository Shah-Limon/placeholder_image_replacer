**What is the best way to clean Coretec Plus flooring?**

The best way to clean Coretec Plus flooring involves regular sweeping or vacuuming to remove debris, followed by damp mopping with a pH-neutral cleaner. Avoid harsh chemicals and abrasive tools to protect the floor’s finish and waterproof core.



## Daily & Weekly Maintenance for Coretec Plus

Consistent, simple cleaning is the key to keeping your Coretec Plus floors looking fantastic. A little effort each week goes a long way in preventing dirt buildup and maintaining the floor’s protective wear layer. Start with a routine that fits your lifestyle and household traffic.

*   **Sweeping/Vacuuming:** Sweep or vacuum at least twice a week, or more often in high-traffic areas. Use a soft-bristled broom or a vacuum with a hard floor attachment to avoid scratches.
*   **Dust Mopping:** Consider using a microfiber dust mop between vacuuming sessions to quickly pick up dust and pet hair. These are incredibly effective and save time.
*   **Entryway Mats:** Place mats at all entrances to trap dirt and moisture before they reach your Coretec Plus floors. This is a simple preventative measure that significantly reduces cleaning needs.
*   **Furniture Protection:** Use felt pads under furniture legs to prevent scratches and dents. This is especially important for heavy items.



## Choosing the Right Cleaning Solutions

Selecting the right cleaner is crucial for Coretec Plus vinyl flooring. Harsh chemicals can damage the finish and void your warranty. Always opt for pH-neutral solutions specifically formulated for vinyl or luxury vinyl plank (LVP) floors. 

*   **pH-Neutral Cleaners:** These cleaners are gentle yet effective at removing dirt and grime without harming the floor’s surface. Look for products labeled “for vinyl floors” or “pH-neutral.”
*   **Avoid These:** Steer clear of abrasive cleaners, scouring powders, solvent-based cleaners, and anything containing ammonia or bleach. These can dull the finish and cause discoloration.
*   **DIY Option:** A mild solution of warm water and a few drops of dish soap can work in a pinch, but always test it in an inconspicuous area first.

## The Mopping Process: Step-by-Step

Mopping your Coretec Plus floors is a straightforward process when done correctly. Remember, less is more when it comes to water. Excessive moisture can seep into the seams and potentially cause issues.

1.  **Prepare Your Solution:** Mix your chosen pH-neutral cleaner with warm water according to the product instructions.
2.  **Damp Mop:** Dip a microfiber mop into the cleaning solution and wring it out thoroughly. The mop should be damp, not soaking wet.
3.  **Mop in Sections:** Mop the floor in sections, overlapping each pass slightly.
4.  **Rinse (Optional):** If desired, follow up with a clean, damp mop to remove any remaining cleaner residue.
5.  **Dry Thoroughly:** Allow the floor to air dry completely. You can speed up the process with a clean, dry microfiber cloth.



## Tackling Tough Stains on Coretec Plus

Even with regular cleaning, spills and stains happen. Addressing them promptly is key to preventing permanent damage. Here’s how to handle some common culprits:

*   **Oil-Based Stains (Grease, Cooking Oil):** Blot up as much oil as possible with a clean cloth. Then, apply a paste of baking soda and water to the stain and let it sit for 30 minutes before wiping clean.
*   **Ink/Marker:** Try rubbing alcohol on a clean cloth, gently blotting the stain. Test in an inconspicuous area first.
*   **Coffee/Tea:** Wipe up the spill immediately. If a stain remains, use a mild solution of dish soap and warm water.
*   **Pet Stains:** Clean up accidents immediately with an enzymatic cleaner designed for pet stains. This will help neutralize odors and prevent discoloration.

*   **Avoid Dragging Heavy Objects:** Always lift and carry heavy furniture to prevent scratches and dents.
*   **Use Area Rugs:** Place area rugs in high-traffic areas and under furniture to provide extra protection.
*   **Regular Maintenance:** Stick to a consistent cleaning schedule to prevent dirt and grime from building up.
