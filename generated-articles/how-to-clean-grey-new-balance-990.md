Proper cleaning will not only improve their appearance but also extend their lifespan. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to effectively clean your Grey New Balance 990s and keep them looking their best. We’ll cover everything from gathering supplies to tackling tough stains, ensuring your sneakers stay in top condition.

**Takeaway:**

*   Use a soft brush and mild soap for regular cleaning.
*   Address stains promptly with a specialized cleaner.
*   Air dry your sneakers away from direct heat.
*   Protect them with a sneaker protector after cleaning.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean your Grey New Balance 990s, gently brush off loose dirt, mix mild soap with lukewarm water, and scrub the shoes with a soft brush. Rinse with clean water and air dry, avoiding direct sunlight or heat.



## 1. Gathering Your Cleaning Supplies for New Balance 990s

Before you start, having the right tools makes the job much easier. You don’t need anything fancy, just a few essential items.  This preparation will ensure a thorough and safe cleaning process for your sneakers.  Let's get everything ready so you can restore your New Balance 990s to their former glory.

Here’s what you’ll need:

*   **Soft-bristled brush:** An old toothbrush works great for detailed areas.
*   **Mild soap:** Dish soap or laundry detergent (avoid harsh chemicals).
*   **Lukewarm water:**  Avoid hot water, as it can damage materials.
*   **Microfiber cloths:** For wiping and drying.
*   **Sneaker cleaner (optional):** For tougher stains.
*   **Magic Eraser (optional):** For cleaning midsoles.
*   **Shoe trees or paper towels:** To help maintain shape while drying.

## 2. Initial Cleaning: Removing Loose Dirt and Debris

The first step in cleaning your Grey New Balance 990s is to remove any loose dirt or debris. This prevents you from grinding the dirt into the material during the washing process.  Taking this initial step will make the deeper cleaning much more effective.

*   Use a soft-bristled brush to gently sweep away dirt from the upper, midsole, and outsole.
*   Pay attention to the grooves in the outsole where dirt tends to accumulate.
*   Remove the laces and insoles. You can wash the laces separately in a mesh laundry bag.  Consider cleaning the insoles with a gentle cleaner as well.
*   If your laces are particularly dirty, you might consider replacing them.



## 3. Cleaning the Upper: A Gentle Approach

The upper of your Grey New Balance 990s is often made of suede, nubuck, or a combination of materials.  Therefore, a gentle approach is crucial to avoid damage.  Using the wrong cleaning method can alter the texture or color of the material.

*   Mix a small amount of mild soap with lukewarm water.
*   Dip a microfiber cloth into the soapy water and wring it out well. You want the cloth to be damp, not soaking wet.
*   Gently wipe the upper in circular motions. Avoid scrubbing aggressively.
*   For suede or nubuck, use a dedicated suede cleaner and brush.  [https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-ceramic](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-ceramic) offers guidance on delicate materials.
*   If you encounter stubborn marks, repeat the process with a slightly more concentrated soap solution.

## 4. Tackling the Midsole and Outsole

The midsole and outsole of your New Balance 990s are typically more durable and can withstand a bit more cleaning power. However, it’s still important to be careful and avoid harsh chemicals.  A clean midsole and outsole will significantly improve the overall appearance of your sneakers.

*   For the midsole, a Magic Eraser can work wonders on scuffs and marks. Gently rub the affected areas.
*   For the outsole, use the soft-bristled brush and soapy water to scrub away dirt and grime.
*   Pay attention to the grooves and treads, where dirt often gets trapped.
*   For particularly stubborn dirt, you can use a slightly stronger cleaning solution, but test it in an inconspicuous area first.  You can also find helpful tips on cleaning different surfaces at [https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-aluminum](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-aluminum).

## 5. Dealing with Stubborn Stains on Your 990s

Sometimes, gentle cleaning isn’t enough to remove stubborn stains.  Different types of stains require different approaches.  Identifying the stain type is the first step to effective removal.

*   **Oil-based stains:** Sprinkle baking soda on the stain and let it sit for several hours to absorb the oil. Then, brush it off.
*   **Mud stains:** Let the mud dry completely, then brush it off. If a stain remains, use a damp cloth and mild soap.
*   **Scuff marks:** A Magic Eraser can often remove scuff marks from the midsole.
*   **For tough stains:** Consider using a specialized sneaker cleaner designed for the material of your 990s. Always follow the product instructions carefully.

## 6. Drying and Protecting Your Clean New Balance 990s

Proper drying is crucial to prevent damage and maintain the shape of your sneakers.  Avoid methods that can warp or discolor the materials.  Protecting your sneakers after cleaning will help keep them looking fresh for longer.

*   **Air dry:** Allow your sneakers to air dry naturally, away from direct sunlight or heat.
*   **Shoe trees or paper towels:** Stuff the sneakers with shoe trees or paper towels to help them maintain their shape while drying.
*   **Avoid the dryer:** Never put your sneakers in the dryer, as the heat can damage the materials.
*   **Sneaker protector:** Once dry, apply a sneaker protector spray to help repel water and stains. This will help keep your Grey New Balance 990s looking their best.
