Cleaning your Costa sunglasses regularly ensures optimal vision and prevents scratches that can damage the lenses. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about cleaning your Costa sunglasses, from daily maintenance to tackling tougher grime. We’ll cover the best methods, products to avoid, and how to keep your investment looking its best for years to come.

**Takeaway:**

*   Use fresh water and a microfiber cloth for daily cleaning.

*   Proper storage protects lenses from scratches.
*   Regular cleaning maintains clarity and extends the life of your sunglasses.

**Quick Answer:** To clean Costa sunglasses, rinse them with fresh, cool water to remove debris. Then, gently wipe the lenses with a clean microfiber cloth. Avoid using soaps, detergents, or abrasive materials that can damage the lenses' coatings.

## Understanding Your Costa Sunglasses: Lens Materials & Coatings

Costa sunglasses are known for their high-quality lenses, often made from polycarbonate or glass.  These materials offer excellent clarity and impact resistance, but they require specific care. Many Costa lenses also feature specialized coatings, like scratch-resistant or anti-reflective layers, which are susceptible to damage from improper cleaning. Knowing your lens type is the first step to ensuring you clean them correctly.  

Costa offers several lens technologies, including 580G and 580P.

These lenses block glare and enhance colors, but they also require gentle handling.  Always check the Costa website or your product documentation for specific care instructions related to your lens type.

## Daily Cleaning: The Simple Routine

A quick daily cleaning routine can prevent buildup and keep your Costa sunglasses looking their best. Start by rinsing your sunglasses under cool, fresh water. This removes loose dirt, dust, and salt spray.  Never use hot water, as it can damage the lens coatings.  

Next, gently wipe the lenses with a clean, lint-free microfiber cloth.  Fold the cloth to create a clean surface as you work. Avoid circular motions, as these can sometimes spread debris.  Instead, wipe in a straight line across the lens.  A microfiber cloth is essential because it won’t scratch the lenses like paper towels or other abrasive materials.

## Tackling Tougher Grime: Saltwater, Sunscreen & More

Sometimes, a simple rinse and wipe aren’t enough. Saltwater, sunscreen, and oily fingerprints can leave stubborn residue on your Costa sunglasses. For these situations, a specialized lens cleaner is your best bet. Costa sells its own lens cleaner, which is formulated to be safe for their lenses. 

If you don’t have Costa’s cleaner, you can use a mild dish soap diluted in cool water. Apply a tiny amount of the solution to the lenses and gently rub with a microfiber cloth. Rinse thoroughly with fresh water to remove all traces of soap.  Avoid getting soap inside the frame, as it can be difficult to remove.

## What *Not* To Do: Avoiding Damage to Your Lenses

Knowing what *not* to do is just as important as knowing what *to* do when cleaning your Costa sunglasses.  Never use abrasive cleaners, such as scouring powders or window cleaners. These can scratch the lenses and damage the coatings.  

Avoid paper towels, tissues, and clothing, as these can also cause scratches.  Household cleaners containing ammonia or alcohol are also a no-go.  These chemicals can strip the lens coatings and cause discoloration.  Finally, never attempt to clean your lenses when they are dry and covered in grit, as this will grind the particles into the lens surface.

## Proper Storage: Protecting Your Investment

Proper storage is crucial for protecting your Costa sunglasses from scratches and damage. Always store your sunglasses in a case when you’re not wearing them. The case should be clean and free of debris.  

Avoid tossing your sunglasses into a bag or pocket, as this can lead to scratches.  If you don’t have a case, wrap your sunglasses in a microfiber cloth for added protection.  Storing your sunglasses in a cool, dry place will also help prevent damage.

## Deep Cleaning & Frame Care

While focusing on the lenses is vital, don’t neglect the frames of your Costa sunglasses.  The frames can accumulate dirt, sweat, and oils.  To clean the frames, use a mild dish soap and warm water. Gently scrub with a soft brush or cloth, paying attention to areas around the nose pads and hinges. 

Rinse thoroughly with warm water and dry with a clean cloth. For stubborn buildup, you can use a cotton swab dipped in isopropyl alcohol to clean hard-to-reach areas. Be careful not to get alcohol on the lenses.  Regular frame cleaning keeps your sunglasses looking and feeling fresh.
