## Keeping Your Spa Fresh: How To Clean Hot Tub Plumbing

Is your hot tub not feeling as relaxing as it used to? Often, the issue isn’t the water itself, but a buildup of grime within your hot tub plumbing. Cleaning your hot tub plumbing is a crucial, yet often overlooked, part of hot tub maintenance. This article will guide you through a comprehensive process to ensure your spa remains a clean and enjoyable oasis. We’ll cover everything from identifying the need for cleaning to the best methods and preventative measures.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly clean your hot tub plumbing to prevent biofilm buildup.
*   Use a plumbing cleaner specifically designed for hot tubs.
*   Flush the system thoroughly after cleaning.
*   Maintain proper water chemistry to minimize future buildup.

**What does it mean to clean hot tub plumbing?**

Cleaning hot tub plumbing involves removing biofilm, scale, and other debris that accumulates inside the pipes, jets, and components of your hot tub’s circulation system. This process ensures efficient water flow and prevents the growth of bacteria and algae.

## Why Cleaning Hot Tub Plumbing Matters

You might be diligently cleaning your hot tub filter and balancing your water chemistry, but that’s not enough. Biofilm, a slimy layer of bacteria, can thrive within the hidden recesses of your plumbing. This biofilm can harbor harmful bacteria, leading to unpleasant odors, cloudy water, and even potential health risks. Regular cleaning of your hot tub plumbing helps eliminate this biofilm, ensuring a healthier and more enjoyable soaking experience.  Think of it like brushing your teeth – you wouldn’t just rinse, would you? 

Furthermore, buildup restricts water flow, making your jets less effective and potentially straining your hot tub’s pump.  Addressing this issue proactively can extend the life of your equipment and save you money on repairs.

## Identifying When Your Plumbing Needs Cleaning

How do you know when it’s time to tackle the plumbing? Several signs indicate a need for a thorough cleaning.  A persistent foamy or slimy residue, even after water balancing, is a strong indicator.  Cloudy water that doesn’t clear with regular sanitation is another clue.  You might also notice a musty or unpleasant odor emanating from the jets. 

If you’ve recently purchased a used hot tub, or if you’ve let your hot tub sit unused for an extended period, cleaning the plumbing is highly recommended.  A good rule of thumb is to perform a deep plumbing clean at least once or twice a year, depending on usage.  Don't forget to also keep your [hot tub cover](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-hot-tub-cover) clean to prevent debris from entering the system.

## Gathering Your Supplies

Before you begin, gather the necessary supplies. You’ll need a hot tub plumbing cleaner – *never* use household cleaners, as they can damage your system. Look for a product specifically formulated for hot tub plumbing, often containing enzymes or citric acid. A garden hose is essential for flushing the system.  

You may also want to have a bucket and some old towels on hand for any spills.  Gloves and eye protection are recommended, as some cleaners can be irritating. Finally, ensure you have access to your hot tub’s owner’s manual, as it may contain specific instructions for your model.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Your Hot Tub Plumbing

Now, let’s get down to the cleaning process.

1.  **Drain the Hot Tub:** Completely drain your hot tub.  You can find detailed instructions on [how to clean a drained hot tub](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-drained-hot-tub) if you need assistance.
2.  **Add the Plumbing Cleaner:** Follow the instructions on your chosen plumbing cleaner. Typically, you’ll pour the cleaner directly into the hot tub shell.
3.  **Fill and Circulate:** Refill the hot tub with fresh water, enough to cover the pump and jets. Turn on the jets and allow the system to circulate for the recommended time, usually 20-30 minutes. This allows the cleaner to travel throughout the plumbing.
4.  **Flush the System:** Drain the hot tub again. Then, using a garden hose, flush the plumbing by running water through each jet individually. This helps remove loosened debris.
5.  **Repeat if Necessary:** If the water draining from the jets is still cloudy or contains debris, repeat steps 3 and 4.
6.  **Refill and Balance:** Once the water runs clear, refill the hot tub with fresh water and balance the chemistry according to your hot tub’s instructions.

## Maintaining Clean Plumbing: Preventative Measures

Cleaning your hot tub plumbing is important, but preventing buildup is even better. Maintaining proper water chemistry is the first line of defense. Regularly test and adjust the pH, alkalinity, and sanitizer levels.  Shocking your hot tub weekly helps oxidize organic contaminants. 

Consider using a pre-filter on your fill hose to remove minerals and other impurities from the incoming water.  Also, avoid leaving the hot tub uncovered for extended periods, as this allows debris to enter the system.  If you're dealing with particularly stubborn issues, you might want to consider a professional cleaning service.
