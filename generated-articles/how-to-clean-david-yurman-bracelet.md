## Understanding Your David Yurman Bracelet’s Materials

Before you begin cleaning, it’s important to understand what your bracelet is made of. David Yurman bracelets come in a variety of materials, including sterling silver, gold, and often feature diamonds or other gemstones. Knowing the material will dictate the best cleaning approach. Sterling silver is prone to tarnishing, while gold requires a gentler touch. Diamonds, though durable, can still be affected by harsh chemicals. 

*   **Sterling Silver:** This metal will tarnish over time, requiring regular polishing.
*   **Gold:** Yellow, white, and rose gold all require gentle cleaning to avoid scratches.
*   **Gemstones:** Diamonds, sapphires, and other stones need special care to maintain their sparkle.
*   **Cable Designs:** The signature cable motif can trap dirt and grime, requiring thorough cleaning.

## Daily & Weekly Maintenance for a Sparkling Bracelet

Consistent, gentle care is the best way to prevent significant buildup and keep your David Yurman bracelet looking its best. A quick wipe-down after each wear can make a huge difference. This removes oils from your skin and prevents tarnish from forming. Weekly cleaning with a soft cloth will further maintain the shine.

*   **After Each Wear:** Wipe with a soft, lint-free cloth to remove oils and dirt.
*   **Weekly Cleaning:** Use a slightly damp cloth to gently clean the entire surface.
*   **Avoid Contact:** Remove your bracelet before showering, swimming, or applying lotions and perfumes.
*   **Proper Storage:** Store your bracelet in a soft pouch or jewelry box to prevent scratches and tarnishing. You might also consider using anti-tarnish strips.
