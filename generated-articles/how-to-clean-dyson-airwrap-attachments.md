## Keeping Your Style Flowing: How To Clean Dyson Airwrap Attachments

Is your Dyson Airwrap not performing as flawlessly as it once did? A buildup of hair, product residue, and dust can significantly impact its performance. Regularly cleaning your Dyson Airwrap attachments is crucial for maintaining optimal airflow and achieving the best styling results. This article will guide you through a step-by-step process for cleaning each attachment, ensuring your Airwrap continues to deliver salon-worthy styles. We’ll cover everything from the barrel attachments to the smoothing dryer, keeping your tool in top condition.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly clean your Dyson Airwrap attachments to maintain performance.
*   Disassemble attachments for thorough cleaning.
*   Use a soft brush and microfiber cloth for delicate parts.
*   Ensure attachments are completely dry before reassembling.

**Quick Answer:** To clean your Dyson Airwrap attachments, first disconnect them from the main body. Then, remove any visible hair and use a soft brush to dislodge debris. Wipe down the attachments with a microfiber cloth dampened with water, and allow them to dry completely before reattaching.

## Understanding Why Cleaning Your Attachments Matters

Your Dyson Airwrap is an investment, and like any valuable tool, it requires proper care. Over time, hairspray, serums, and natural oils accumulate inside the attachments, reducing airflow and potentially causing overheating. This buildup can lead to decreased performance, uneven styling, and even damage to the motor. Cleaning your attachments regularly prevents these issues, extending the life of your Airwrap and ensuring consistent, beautiful results. It’s a simple process that makes a big difference.

## Cleaning the Dyson Airwrap Barrels

The barrels are arguably the most frequently used attachments and therefore accumulate the most product buildup. Start by disconnecting the barrel from the Airwrap. Gently twist and pull to separate the outer barrel from the inner heating element. Use a soft brush, like a toothbrush, to remove any visible hair or debris from both the inner and outer components. For stubborn residue, lightly dampen the brush with water. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the finish. Finally, wipe down both pieces with a clean, dry microfiber cloth. [Learn more about maintaining your Dyson Airwrap](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-dyson-airwrap).

### Addressing Stubborn Product Buildup in Barrels

Sometimes, a simple brush isn’t enough to remove stubborn product buildup. In these cases, you can use a slightly damp microfiber cloth with a tiny amount of mild dish soap. Gently wipe the affected areas, then rinse the cloth with clean water and wipe again to remove any soap residue. Ensure the barrel is completely dry before reassembling. Remember, moisture is the enemy of electrical appliances, so patience is key.

## Cleaning the Smoothing Dryer Attachment

The smoothing dryer attachment is designed to quickly dry and smooth hair, but it can also collect lint and hair. Begin by disconnecting the attachment from the Airwrap. Use your fingers or a soft brush to remove any loose hair from the air intake vents. Then, wipe down the exterior of the attachment with a damp microfiber cloth. Pay attention to the nozzle, as this is where product buildup is most likely to occur. Avoid getting water inside the attachment.

## Cleaning the Pre-Styling Dryer

The pre-styling dryer is used to remove excess moisture from hair before styling. This attachment is prone to collecting hair and product residue. Disconnect the attachment and use a soft brush to remove any visible debris from the air intake. Wipe down the exterior with a damp microfiber cloth, focusing on the nozzle and handle. Ensure the attachment is completely dry before reattaching it to the Airwrap.

## Cleaning the Round Brush Attachments

The round brush attachments are used for creating volume and smooth, bouncy curls. These attachments require a bit more attention to detail. Disconnect the brush from the Airwrap. Carefully remove any hair wrapped around the bristles. Use a soft brush to clean between the bristles and remove any product buildup. Wipe down the brush body with a damp microfiber cloth. Allow the brush to air dry completely before reassembling. [Keeping your Dyson filter clean is also important](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-often-to-clean-the-dyson-airwrap-filter).

### Maintaining Bristle Integrity

The bristles on your round brush attachments are delicate. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the bristles. If the bristles become bent or misshapen, you can gently reshape them with your fingers. Proper cleaning and care will help maintain the integrity of the bristles and extend the life of your round brush attachments.

## Cleaning the Firm Smoothing Brush and Wide-Tooth Comb

These attachments are relatively easy to clean. Simply remove any visible hair and wipe down the surfaces with a damp microfiber cloth. For the wide-tooth comb, you can use a fine-tooth comb to remove any stubborn debris between the teeth. Ensure both attachments are completely dry before storing them.
