## Keeping Your Clothes Fresh: How to Clean a GE Smart Dispense Washer

Is your GE Smart Dispense washer starting to smell a little funky? Don't worry, it happens! Over time, detergent residue, fabric softener, and even mildew can build up inside your washing machine, leading to unpleasant odors and potentially affecting your laundry's cleanliness. Cleaning your GE Smart Dispense washer regularly is key to keeping it performing at its best and your clothes smelling fresh. This article will walk you through a comprehensive cleaning process, ensuring your washer stays in top condition. We’ll cover everything from the dispenser to the drum, giving you a complete guide to maintaining this smart appliance.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning prevents odors and mildew.
*   The Smart Dispense system requires specific attention.
*   A monthly cleaning cycle helps maintain performance.
*   Proper ventilation is crucial for preventing buildup.

**Quick Answer:** To clean a GE Smart Dispense washer, run a cleaning cycle with washer cleaner, wipe down the dispenser and door, and clean the drain pump filter monthly. This removes residue and prevents odors, ensuring optimal performance.

## Understanding the GE Smart Dispense System

The GE Smart Dispense washer is a fantastic appliance, but its advanced system requires a little extra care. Unlike traditional washers, the Smart Dispense automatically distributes detergent based on your load size and fabric type. This is incredibly convenient, but it also means detergent can accumulate in the dispenser and lines.  Regularly cleaning this system is vital to prevent clogs and ensure accurate dispensing.  A clogged dispenser can lead to detergent buildup in the washer drum, impacting your wash results.  Let's dive into how to keep this smart feature functioning flawlessly.

## Cleaning the Smart Dispense Detergent Reservoir

The detergent reservoir is the heart of the Smart Dispense system, and it needs regular attention. Start by removing the detergent reservoir – usually, there’s a release button or latch.  Empty any remaining detergent and rinse the reservoir thoroughly with warm water.  For stubborn residue, create a solution of equal parts water and white vinegar and let it soak for about 30 minutes.  After soaking, scrub gently with a soft brush to remove any lingering buildup.  Finally, rinse again and allow the reservoir to air dry completely before reinstalling it.

## Deep Cleaning the Washer Drum

The washer drum itself needs regular cleaning to remove detergent residue, fabric softener buildup, and potential mildew. GE washers often have a specific “Washer Clean” cycle – consult your owner’s manual to find it. If your model has this cycle, run it monthly with a washer cleaner specifically designed for HE (High Efficiency) washers. If your washer doesn’t have a dedicated cleaning cycle, run a hot water cycle with two cups of white vinegar.  After the cycle completes, wipe down the inside of the drum with a clean, damp cloth.  This simple step can make a big difference in keeping your washer fresh and clean.

## Addressing the Washer Gasket and Door

The rubber gasket around the washer door is a prime location for mildew and grime to accumulate. After each wash, wipe down the gasket with a clean, dry cloth to remove any excess moisture.  Pay close attention to the folds and crevices, as these areas are prone to trapping debris.  Periodically, you can use a solution of equal parts water and white vinegar to disinfect the gasket.  Apply the solution, let it sit for a few minutes, and then wipe clean.  Don't forget to wipe down the inside of the washer door as well.  A clean gasket prevents odors and extends the life of your washer.

## Cleaning the Drain Pump Filter

The drain pump filter catches lint, hair, and other debris that can clog the drain pump. Cleaning this filter is essential for preventing drainage issues and maintaining your washer’s performance.  The location of the drain pump filter varies depending on your model, so consult your owner’s manual.  Typically, you’ll find it behind a small access panel on the front of the washer.  Before opening the access panel, place a shallow pan or towel underneath to catch any water that may spill out.  Remove the filter and clean it thoroughly under running water, removing any accumulated debris.  Reinstall the filter securely.  Cleaning the filter monthly is a good practice.

## Maintaining Proper Ventilation and Preventing Odors

Proper ventilation is crucial for preventing mildew and odors in your GE Smart Dispense washer. After each wash, leave the washer door slightly ajar to allow air to circulate. This helps to dry out the drum and gasket, preventing the growth of mildew.  Avoid overloading the washer, as this can restrict airflow and contribute to moisture buildup.  If you live in a humid climate, consider using a dehumidifier in the laundry room.  Regular cleaning, combined with good ventilation, will keep your washer smelling fresh and clean.
