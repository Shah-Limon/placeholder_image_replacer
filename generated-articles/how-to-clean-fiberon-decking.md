## Understanding Your Fiberon Decking Material

Before diving into cleaning, it’s important to understand the type of Fiberon decking you have. Fiberon offers several different product lines, each with slightly different cleaning recommendations. Knowing your decking’s specific material will help you choose the right cleaning methods and products. Generally, Fiberon decking falls into these categories:

*   **Fiberon Classic:** This line is a composite material made from wood flour and plastic. It’s durable and requires minimal maintenance.
*   **Fiberon Pro:** Offering enhanced stain and fade resistance, Pro decking is a great choice for high-traffic areas.
*   **Fiberon Vista:** This premium line features realistic wood-grain patterns and exceptional durability.
*   **Fiberon Symmetry:** Known for its beautiful aesthetics and advanced performance, Symmetry decking is a top-tier option.

You can find the specific product line information on your original purchase documentation or on the Fiberon website. Understanding this will help you choose the best cleaning approach.

## Routine Cleaning: Maintaining a Pristine Deck

Regular cleaning is the key to keeping your Fiberon deck looking its best. A quick routine can prevent dirt and grime from building up and causing stubborn stains. Here’s how to incorporate routine cleaning into your deck maintenance schedule:

*   **Sweep or Blow:** Weekly, sweep or blow away leaves, dirt, and other debris. This prevents buildup and keeps your deck looking tidy.
*   **Wash with Soap and Water:** Every few months, wash the deck with a mild soap (like dish soap) and warm water. Use a soft-bristled brush to scrub the surface gently.
*   **Rinse Thoroughly:** After scrubbing, rinse the deck thoroughly with a garden hose. Ensure all soap residue is removed.
*   **Avoid Pressure Washing:** While tempting, pressure washing can damage the surface of your Fiberon decking. If you must use a pressure washer, use a very low setting and a wide fan nozzle.

## Tackling Stubborn Stains on Fiberon Decking

Even with regular cleaning, stains can happen. Fortunately, most stains can be removed with the right approach. Here’s how to tackle some common culprits:

*   **Mold and Mildew:** Mix a solution of one part bleach to four parts water. Apply to the affected area, let it sit for 10-15 minutes, then scrub with a soft-bristled brush and rinse thoroughly. *Always test this solution in an inconspicuous area first.*
*   **Oil and Grease:** Use a degreasing cleaner specifically designed for composite decking. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully.
*   **Food and Drink Spills:** Clean up spills immediately with soap and water. For stubborn stains, try a composite deck cleaner.
*   **Rust:** Use a rust remover specifically formulated for outdoor surfaces. Be sure to rinse thoroughly after application.

Fiberon also offers its own line of deck cleaners and stain removers, which are specifically designed for their products. You can find these on their website or at your local hardware store.

## Preventing Future Stains and Damage

Prevention is always better than cure. Here are some tips to help prevent future stains and damage to your Fiberon deck:

If your Fiberon deck is heavily soiled or stained, you may need to perform a deep cleaning and restoration. This involves using a specialized deck cleaner and a more thorough scrubbing process. Consider these steps:

*   **Apply Deck Cleaner:** Apply a Fiberon-approved deck cleaner according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
*   **Scrub Thoroughly:** Use a soft-bristled brush to scrub the entire deck surface, paying attention to areas with stubborn stains.
*   **Rinse Completely:** Rinse the deck thoroughly with a garden hose, ensuring all cleaner residue is removed.
