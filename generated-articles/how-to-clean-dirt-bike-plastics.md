## Keeping Your Ride Looking Sharp: How To Clean Dirt Bike Plastics

Ever wonder how to get your dirt bike plastics looking brand new again after a muddy ride? It’s a common question for any off-road enthusiast. Cleaning your dirt bike’s plastics isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about protecting them from damage and maintaining your bike’s overall value. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to effectively clean your dirt bike plastics, from the right tools and products to step-by-step instructions. We’ll cover everything from a quick wash after a ride to deeper cleaning and restoration techniques.

**Takeaway:**

*   Use mild soap and water for regular cleaning.
*   Avoid harsh chemicals that can damage the plastic.
*   Protect your plastics with a UV protectant.
*   Regular cleaning prevents mud and grime buildup.

**Quick Answer:** To clean dirt bike plastics, wash the bike with mild soap and water, use a soft brush to remove stubborn dirt, rinse thoroughly, and apply a plastic protectant to prevent fading and cracking.

## Why Regular Cleaning of Dirt Bike Plastics Matters

Dirt bike plastics take a beating. They’re constantly exposed to mud, rocks, sun, and other elements. Regular cleaning is crucial for preventing this exposure from causing long-term damage. Mud and grime can actually scratch the plastic over time, and prolonged sun exposure can cause fading and cracking.  Taking the time to clean your bike after each ride, or at least regularly, will significantly extend the life of your plastics and keep your bike looking its best.  Plus, a clean bike is a happy bike – and a happy rider!

## Gathering Your Cleaning Supplies

Before you start, you’ll need to gather the right supplies. Using the wrong products can actually harm your dirt bike’s plastics. Here’s a checklist of what you’ll need:

*   **Mild Soap:** Dish soap works well, but specifically formulated motorcycle wash is even better.
*   **Water:** A hose with a spray nozzle is ideal.
*   **Soft Brushes:** A variety of soft brushes, including a toothbrush for tight spots.
*   **Microfiber Cloths:** These are gentle and won’t scratch the plastic.
*   **Plastic Protectant:** A UV protectant spray will help prevent fading and cracking.
*   **Bucket:** For mixing your soap and water.
*   **Optional: Pressure Washer:** Use with caution, keeping a safe distance.

## The Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning Your Dirt Bike Plastics

Now that you have your supplies, let’s get cleaning! This process is straightforward and shouldn’t take too long.

1.  **Rinse:** Start by rinsing the entire bike with water to remove loose dirt and mud.
2.  **Wash:** Mix your mild soap with water in a bucket. Apply the soapy water to the plastics using a soft brush or microfiber cloth.
3.  **Scrub:** Gently scrub the plastics to remove any remaining dirt and grime. Pay attention to areas that tend to accumulate more dirt, like around the fenders and side panels.
4.  **Rinse Again:** Thoroughly rinse the bike with clean water, ensuring all soap residue is removed.
5.  **Dry:** Use a clean microfiber cloth to dry the plastics.
6.  **Protect:** Apply a plastic protectant spray to help prevent fading and cracking. This is a crucial step, especially if you ride in sunny conditions.

## Dealing with Stubborn Dirt and Grime

Sometimes, a simple wash isn’t enough. If you’re dealing with stubborn dirt or grime, here are a few tips:

*   **Soak:** Let the soapy water sit on the affected areas for a few minutes to help loosen the dirt.
*   **Toothbrush:** Use a toothbrush to scrub tight spots and crevices.
*   **Pressure Washer (Caution):** A pressure washer can be effective, but use it with caution. Keep a safe distance and use a wide spray nozzle to avoid damaging the plastic.

## Restoring Faded or Scratched Plastics

Over time, dirt bike plastics can become faded or scratched. While you can’t completely reverse these effects, you can improve their appearance.

*   **Plastic Polish:** A plastic polish can help restore some of the shine to faded plastics.
*   **Scratch Removal:** For minor scratches, you can use a plastic scratch remover. Follow the product instructions carefully.
*   **Replacement:** If the damage is severe, you may need to replace the plastic panels.

*   **UV Protection:** Always apply a UV protectant spray after cleaning.
