## Revive Your Ride: How to Clean a Carburetor on a Push Mower

Is your push mower giving you trouble? Does it sputter, refuse to start, or lack its usual power? Often, the culprit is a dirty carburetor. The carburetor mixes air and fuel, and even a small amount of debris can disrupt this process. Cleaning your mower’s carburetor is a surprisingly manageable DIY project that can save you money and get you back to enjoying a perfectly manicured lawn. This guide will walk you through each step of how to clean a carburetor on a push mower, ensuring a smooth and efficient process.

**Takeaway:**

*   Disassemble the carburetor carefully, noting the position of each part.
*   Use carburetor cleaner to dissolve varnish and deposits.
*   Ensure all passages are clear before reassembly.
*   Replace gaskets if necessary for a proper seal.



**Quick Answer:** Cleaning a carburetor on a push mower involves removing it, disassembling it, soaking the parts in carburetor cleaner, clearing jets and passages with fine wire, and reassembling with new gaskets if needed. This restores the proper air-fuel mixture for optimal engine performance.

## Understanding Your Mower’s Carburetor

Before diving in, it’s helpful to understand what the carburetor does. It’s the heart of your mower’s fuel system, responsible for mixing the correct ratio of air and fuel for combustion. Over time, fuel can evaporate, leaving behind varnish and deposits that clog tiny passages within the carburetor. This restricts fuel flow, leading to the problems mentioned earlier. Knowing this helps you appreciate why a thorough cleaning is so important.  Different mowers have different carburetor designs, but the basic principles remain the same. You can often find diagrams specific to your mower model online.

## Gathering Your Tools and Supplies

Having the right tools makes the job much easier. Here’s what you’ll need to clean a carburetor on a push mower:

*   Wrench set
*   Screwdrivers (Phillips and flathead)
*   Carburetor cleaner spray
*   Small wire or carburetor cleaning kit (for clearing jets)
*   Clean rags
*   Safety glasses
*   Gloves
*   Small containers for parts
*   New carburetor gasket(s) (recommended)

Safety first! Always disconnect the spark plug wire before working on your mower to prevent accidental starting.



## Removing the Carburetor from Your Push Mower

Disconnecting the spark plug is the first step. Then, locate the carburetor – it’s usually attached to the engine with a few bolts. Before removing any hoses or linkages, take pictures! These photos will be invaluable when you reassemble everything. Carefully disconnect the fuel line, throttle linkage, and choke linkage.  Then, unbolt the carburetor from the engine.  Be gentle; you don’t want to damage any of the surrounding components.  Once loose, carefully remove the carburetor.

## Disassembling and Cleaning the Carburetor

Now comes the detailed work. Place the carburetor on a clean work surface.  Slowly and carefully disassemble it, keeping track of each part and its position. Small parts can easily get lost, so use those small containers! Spray each component with carburetor cleaner, paying close attention to the jets and passages. Use the small wire or a carburetor cleaning kit to gently clear any obstructions in the jets.  Don't force anything; you could damage the delicate components.

### Focusing on the Jets

The jets are the smallest and most easily clogged parts of the carburetor. They control the amount of fuel that flows into the engine.  Ensure these are completely clear. You can use a fine wire or a specialized jet cleaning tool.  Hold the carburetor up to the light to check for any remaining obstructions.  A clear jet means proper fuel delivery.

## Reassembling and Reinstalling the Carburetor

Once all parts are clean and dry, it’s time to reassemble the carburetor. Refer to the photos you took during disassembly to ensure everything goes back in the correct order. Replace the carburetor gasket(s) – these are inexpensive and crucial for a proper seal.  Carefully reattach the carburetor to the engine, reconnecting the fuel line, throttle linkage, and choke linkage.  Double-check all connections to ensure they are secure.

## Final Checks and Starting Your Mower

Before starting your mower, double-check everything. Ensure the spark plug wire is securely connected. Add fresh fuel to the tank.  Attempt to start the mower. It may take a few tries, especially if the carburetor was severely clogged. If it still doesn’t start, re-examine your work, paying close attention to the fuel line and linkages.  If you're still having trouble, consider consulting a professional mechanic.
