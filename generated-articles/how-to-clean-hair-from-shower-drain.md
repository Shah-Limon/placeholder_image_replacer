## Stop the Soak: How to Clean Hair From Your Shower Drain

Is your shower turning into a miniature swimming pool because the water isn’t draining? Chances are, a hair clog is the culprit. Dealing with a shower drain full of hair is a common household problem, but thankfully, it’s usually a pretty easy fix. This article will walk you through several effective methods to remove that pesky hair and get your shower draining freely again. We’ll cover everything from simple tools to preventative measures, ensuring a smooth shower experience.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly remove visible hair after each shower.
*   Use a drain strainer to catch hair before it enters the drain.
*   Employ tools like bent wire hangers, drain snakes, or wet/dry vacuums to remove clogs.
*   Flush the drain with hot water and baking soda/vinegar solutions for maintenance.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean hair from a shower drain, first remove any visible hair. Then, use a tool like a bent wire hanger, a drain snake, or a wet/dry vacuum to pull out the clog. Finally, flush the drain with hot water to ensure it’s clear.

## Why Hair Clogs Shower Drains

Let's face it, we all shed hair. It’s a natural part of the hair growth cycle, but that shed hair loves to stick to the slick surfaces in your shower and make its way down the drain. The combination of hair, soap scum, and other bathroom debris creates a sticky mess that builds up over time. This buildup restricts water flow, leading to slow draining and eventually, a complete blockage. Preventing this buildup is key, but knowing how to tackle it when it happens is equally important.

## The Power of Prevention: Drain Strainers

Before we dive into *removing* hair, let’s talk about stopping it from getting there in the first place. A drain strainer is your first line of defense against a clogged shower drain. These inexpensive devices sit inside your drain opening and catch hair and other debris before they can travel further down the pipe. 

*   **Types of Strainers:** You can find various types, including mesh strainers, silicone strainers, and even those with tiny holes.
*   **Regular Cleaning:** Remember to clean your strainer regularly – ideally after every few showers – to prevent it from becoming clogged itself.
*   **Simple Solution:** Using a drain strainer is a simple, yet incredibly effective way to avoid the hassle of dealing with a blocked drain. You can find affordable options at most hardware stores.

## DIY Hair Removal Tools: What You Likely Have at Home

You don’t always need to run to the store to tackle a hair-clogged drain. Many effective solutions can be found right in your home. These methods are great for tackling minor clogs before they become major problems.

### Bent Wire Hanger

A bent wire hanger is a classic tool for removing hair from drains. Straighten a wire coat hanger as much as possible, then bend a small hook at one end. Carefully insert the hooked end into the drain and fish around to snag the hair. Pull the hair out slowly and discard it. Repeat until you’re no longer pulling out hair.

### Tweezers or Pliers

For clogs closer to the drain opening, tweezers or pliers can be surprisingly effective. Simply grasp the visible hair and pull it out. This works best for removing larger clumps of hair.

### Wet/Dry Vacuum

A wet/dry vacuum can also be used to suck out hair from the drain. Set the vacuum to its liquid setting and create a tight seal over the drain opening with the hose. Turn on the vacuum and let it do the work. This method is particularly useful for removing loose hair and debris.

## Stepping Up Your Game: Specialized Drain Cleaning Tools

If the DIY methods aren’t cutting it, it’s time to bring in the big guns. Several specialized tools are designed specifically for clearing drain clogs.

### Drain Snake (Auger)

A drain snake, also known as an auger, is a flexible tool that can reach further down the drain to break up or retrieve clogs. Insert the snake into the drain and rotate it as you push it forward. Once you feel resistance, continue rotating to break up the clog or hook onto the hair. Slowly pull the snake out, removing the hair with it.

### Zip-It Tool

The Zip-It tool is a plastic strip with tiny barbs that grab onto hair and debris as you push it down the drain. It’s a simple and affordable option for removing clogs close to the drain opening.

## Natural Drain Cleaning Solutions: Baking Soda and Vinegar

Sometimes, a little chemical reaction is all you need to loosen a clog. Baking soda and vinegar create a fizzing action that can help break down hair and soap scum.

1.  Pour about one cup of baking soda down the drain.
2.  Follow with one cup of vinegar.
3.  Let the mixture fizz for 30 minutes.
4.  Flush the drain with hot water.

This method is a great preventative measure to use regularly to keep your drain flowing smoothly. For a deeper clean of your bathroom, consider [how to clean your bathroom drain](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-bathroom-drain).

If you’ve tried multiple methods and the drain is still clogged, or if you suspect the clog is located deeper within the pipes, it’s time to seek expert help. A plumber has the tools and expertise to diagnose and resolve more complex drain issues.
