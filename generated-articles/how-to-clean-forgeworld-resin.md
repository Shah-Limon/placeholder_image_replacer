## Cleaning Forgeworld Resin: A Step-by-Step Guide

Have you just received a stunning Forgeworld resin kit and are eager to start building? Before you even think about glue or paint, proper cleaning is essential. Forgeworld resin models require a specific approach to ensure a smooth, paint-ready surface. This article will walk you through everything you need to know about cleaning Forgeworld resin, from removing mold lines to washing and prepping for priming. Let’s get your miniatures looking their absolute best!

**Takeaway:**

*   Remove mold lines carefully with a hobby knife.
*   Wash the resin with warm, soapy water to remove release agents.
*   Ensure the model is completely dry before priming.
*   Use appropriate tools and avoid harsh chemicals.

**What is the best way to clean Forgeworld resin?**

The best way to clean Forgeworld resin involves carefully removing mold lines with a hobby knife, washing the model with warm, soapy water to eliminate release agents, and ensuring it's fully dry before priming for paint. This process guarantees a smooth, paint-ready surface.

## Removing Mold Lines From Forgeworld Resin

Mold lines are the thin ridges of excess resin left over from the casting process. These lines are very common on Forgeworld resin models and *must* be removed for a clean finish. Using a sharp hobby knife is the most effective method. Gently scrape along the mold line, taking your time and using light pressure. 

*   **Use a Sharp Blade:** A fresh, sharp blade is crucial for clean cuts and prevents damaging the model.
*   **Light Pressure is Key:** Avoid digging the knife into the resin; let the blade do the work.
*   **Angle the Blade:** Holding the blade at a slight angle can help create a smoother, more natural curve.
*   **Follow Up with Fine Sandpaper:** For stubborn lines or imperfections, use very fine grit sandpaper (600-800 grit) to smooth the surface.

Removing mold lines is tedious, but it significantly improves the final appearance of your model. Don't rush this step! You can find more information on cleaning resin molds at [https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-resin-off-molds](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-resin-off-molds).

## Washing Your Forgeworld Resin Models

Forgeworld resin is cast using a release agent to help separate the resin from the mold. This release agent prevents paint from adhering properly, so it *must* be removed. Washing the model with warm, soapy water is the most effective way to do this.

*   **Warm Water & Mild Soap:** Use lukewarm water and a mild dish soap. Avoid harsh detergents or abrasive cleaners.
*   **Gentle Scrubbing:** Use a soft toothbrush to gently scrub the entire model, paying attention to recesses and details.
*   **Rinse Thoroughly:** Ensure all soap residue is removed. Any remaining soap can interfere with priming.
*   **Repeat if Necessary:** If the water beads up on the surface, repeat the washing process.

Washing removes the oily residue left by the release agent, creating a surface that paint can grip onto.

## Dealing with Stubborn Residue

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, stubborn residue remains on the Forgeworld resin. Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) can be used cautiously to remove this. However, use it sparingly and with proper ventilation.

*   **Dilute the IPA:** Use 70% or 90% IPA diluted with water (a 50/50 mix is a good starting point).
*   **Apply with a Cotton Swab:** Dip a cotton swab into the diluted IPA and gently rub the affected area.
*   **Avoid Prolonged Exposure:** Don't soak the resin in IPA, as it can damage the material.
*   **Re-Wash After IPA:** After using IPA, re-wash the model with warm, soapy water to remove any remaining alcohol residue.

Remember, IPA is a solvent and should be handled with care. Always test in an inconspicuous area first.

## Drying Your Forgeworld Resin Models

Proper drying is crucial before priming. Any remaining moisture can cause the primer to bubble or flake off. Allow the model to air dry completely.

*   **Air Dry is Best:** Let the model air dry on a clean, dry surface.
*   **Avoid Direct Sunlight or Heat:** Direct sunlight or heat can warp the resin.
*   **Check for Moisture:** Before priming, carefully inspect the model for any signs of moisture.
*   **Patience is Key:** Depending on the humidity, it may take several hours for the model to dry completely.

A completely dry surface ensures optimal primer adhesion. If you've accidentally gotten resin on your brushes, learn how to clean them effectively at [https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-epoxy-resin-from-the-brush](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-epoxy-resin-from-the-brush).

## Priming Forgeworld Resin for Painting

Priming creates a uniform surface for the paint to adhere to and helps bring out the details of the model. Use a primer specifically designed for resin.

*   **Resin-Specific Primer:** Acrylic or enamel primers formulated for resin are ideal.
*   **Thin Coats:** Apply several thin coats of primer rather than one thick coat. This prevents obscuring details.
*   **Spray or Brush-On:** You can use spray-on or brush-on primer, depending on your preference.
*   **Check for Coverage:** Ensure the entire model is evenly coated with primer.

A good primer coat is the foundation for a stunning paint job. If you're working with cured resin and need to clean it, this article can help: [https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-cured-resin](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-cured-resin).
