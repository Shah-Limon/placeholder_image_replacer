## Keeping Your Investment Fresh: How to Clean Common Projects

Are your Common Projects sneakers looking a little less than pristine? Don't worry, it happens! These minimalist leather sneakers are a stylish investment, but they require a bit of care to maintain their clean, sophisticated look. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about how to clean Common Projects, from quick daily touch-ups to more intensive cleaning sessions. Weâ€™ll cover the best methods and products to keep your sneakers looking their best for years to come. Let's dive in and restore your Common Projects to their former glory.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly wipe down your sneakers with a damp cloth.
*   Use a dedicated leather cleaner and conditioner.
*   Protect your sneakers with a leather protector spray.
*   Avoid harsh chemicals and abrasive cleaners.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean Common Projects, gently wipe away dirt with a damp cloth. For deeper cleaning, use a leather cleaner specifically designed for white leather, followed by a leather conditioner. Protect them with a leather protector spray to prevent future stains.

## Understanding Common Projects Leather

Common Projects sneakers are renowned for their high-quality Italian leather. This leather, while durable, is also susceptible to dirt, scuffs, and stains. Understanding the type of leather used in your specific pair is the first step to proper cleaning. Most Common Projects sneakers feature full-grain leather, which means the outer layer of the hide is intact. This makes it more resistant to wear and tear, but it still requires gentle care. 

*   **Full-Grain Leather:** Durable and develops a patina over time.
*   **Suede/Nubuck:** Requires specialized suede cleaners and brushes.
*   **Calfskin:** Soft and requires gentle cleaning to avoid damage. 

Knowing your leather type will help you choose the right cleaning products and techniques. For example, using a harsh cleaner on suede will ruin the texture, while a simple wipe-down might suffice for minor dirt on full-grain leather.  If you're unsure, always test a small, inconspicuous area first.

## Daily Maintenance for Long-Lasting Cleanliness

Preventative care is key to keeping your Common Projects looking fresh. A little daily maintenance can go a long way in preventing dirt buildup and stains.  This doesn't require a lot of time or effort, but it will significantly extend the life of your sneakers.

*   **Wipe Down After Each Wear:** Use a soft, damp cloth to wipe away any dirt or dust.
*   **Use Shoe Trees:** Shoe trees help maintain the shape of your sneakers and absorb moisture.
*   **Rotate Your Sneakers:** Don't wear the same pair every day. Rotating allows them to air out and recover.
*   **Avoid Harsh Weather:**  If possible, avoid wearing your Common Projects in heavy rain or snow. If they do get wet, allow them to air dry naturally.

## Deep Cleaning Your Common Projects: Step-by-Step

When your Common Projects need a more thorough cleaning, follow these steps. This process is ideal for removing stubborn dirt, scuffs, and stains. Remember to always test any cleaning product on a small, hidden area first.

1.  **Remove Laces:** Take out the laces and wash them separately with mild soap and water.
2.  **Dry Brush:** Use a soft-bristled brush to remove loose dirt and debris.
3.  **Leather Cleaner:** Apply a dedicated leather cleaner specifically designed for white leather. Follow the product instructions carefully.
4.  **Gentle Scrubbing:** Use a soft cloth or brush to gently scrub the leather in circular motions.
5.  **Wipe Clean:** Wipe away the cleaner with a clean, damp cloth.
6.  **Leather Conditioner:** Apply a leather conditioner to replenish moisture and prevent cracking.
7.  **Air Dry:** Allow the sneakers to air dry completely, away from direct heat or sunlight.

For particularly stubborn stains, you might consider a specialized stain remover, but always test it first.  You can also find helpful tips on [how to clean a paint can](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-paint-can) for removing paint splatters, should the unfortunate happen.

## Tackling Specific Issues: Scuffs and Stains

Common Projects are prone to scuffs and stains, especially the white leather versions. Here's how to address some common issues.

*   **Scuffs:** Gently rub the scuff with a clean eraser or a specialized scuff remover.
*   **Oil Stains:** Sprinkle cornstarch on the stain and let it sit overnight. Vacuum off the cornstarch in the morning.
*   **Mud Stains:** Allow the mud to dry completely, then brush it off with a soft brush.
*   **Water Stains:** Wipe the entire shoe with a damp cloth to create a uniform appearance.

Avoid using harsh chemicals like bleach or ammonia, as these can damage the leather. If you're dealing with a particularly difficult stain, consider taking your sneakers to a professional cleaner.

## Caring for Suede and Nubuck Common Projects

If your Common Projects feature suede or nubuck, the cleaning process is slightly different. These materials are more delicate and require specialized care.

*   **Suede Brush:** Use a suede brush to remove dirt and restore the nap.
*   **Suede Cleaner:** Apply a dedicated suede cleaner, following the product instructions.
*   **Suede Protector:** Protect your suede sneakers with a suede protector spray.
*   **Avoid Water:** Suede is sensitive to water, so avoid wearing your sneakers in wet conditions.

Never use water or harsh chemicals on suede or nubuck.  Always test any cleaning product on a small, hidden area first.  You can also learn more about protecting your belongings by reading about [how to clean a boat](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-boat).

*   **Shoe Trees:** Use shoe trees to maintain the shape and absorb moisture.
*   **Storage:** Store your sneakers in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight.
