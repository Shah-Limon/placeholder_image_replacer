## Keeping Your Sound Clear: How To Clean DT 770 Pro Headphones

Are your beloved Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro headphones starting to show signs of wear and tear? Don't worry, a little cleaning can go a long way in restoring their pristine condition and ensuring optimal sound quality.  The DT 770 Pro are a popular choice for musicians and audio enthusiasts, and regular cleaning is essential for longevity. This guide will walk you through a comprehensive cleaning process, covering everything from the earcups to the headband. We’ll cover the best methods and materials to use, so you can confidently maintain your investment.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly wipe down your DT 770 Pro with a microfiber cloth.
*   Use isopropyl alcohol for stubborn grime, but dilute it properly.
*   Replace earpads when they become worn or damaged.
*   Avoid harsh chemicals and excessive moisture.

Here's a quick answer to the main question: To clean your DT 770 Pro headphones, gently wipe down the exterior with a slightly damp microfiber cloth. For tougher grime, use a diluted isopropyl alcohol solution (70% alcohol, 30% water) on a cloth, avoiding direct application to the headphones.

## Understanding Your DT 770 Pro Materials

Before diving into the cleaning process, it’s important to understand what your DT 770 Pro headphones are made of. The majority of the exterior is constructed from durable plastic and velour or leatherette earpads.  Knowing this helps you choose the right cleaning methods and avoid damaging sensitive components. The headband also features a padded section, often covered in a similar material to the earpads.  Different materials require different approaches, so let's break it down.

## Cleaning the Earpads: Velour vs. Leatherette

The earpads are often the dirtiest part of your DT 770 Pro headphones, as they come into direct contact with your skin and hair.  The cleaning method depends on whether you have velour or leatherette earpads.  Velour pads require a gentler touch, while leatherette pads can withstand slightly more robust cleaning.

### Cleaning Velour Earpads

Velour is a delicate fabric, so avoid harsh chemicals and abrasive cleaners.  Instead, use a dry microfiber cloth to gently brush away dust and debris. For light stains, you can lightly dampen the cloth with distilled water.  If you need a deeper clean, consider a specialized fabric cleaner designed for velour, testing it on an inconspicuous area first.

### Cleaning Leatherette Earpads

Leatherette is more durable and easier to clean than velour.  You can use a slightly damp microfiber cloth with a mild soap solution (like dish soap diluted in water). Gently wipe the surface, then rinse with a clean, damp cloth.  Avoid soaking the earpads, as this can damage the internal foam.  For stubborn marks, a diluted isopropyl alcohol solution (70% alcohol, 30% water) can be effective, but always test it in an inconspicuous area first.

## Cleaning the Headband and Exterior Plastic

The headband and exterior plastic of your DT 770 Pro headphones are relatively easy to clean.  Dust and grime can accumulate over time, but a simple wipe-down is usually sufficient.  Start by using a dry microfiber cloth to remove loose dust and debris.  For more stubborn dirt, dampen the cloth with a mild soap solution.  

Avoid spraying any liquid directly onto the headphones.  Instead, spray the cloth and then wipe the surfaces.  Pay attention to the areas where the headband contacts your head, as these can accumulate sweat and oils.  You can also use a cotton swab dipped in the soap solution to clean hard-to-reach areas.

## Dealing with Stubborn Grime and Discoloration

Sometimes, a simple wipe-down isn't enough to remove stubborn grime or discoloration.  In these cases, you can try using a diluted isopropyl alcohol solution (70% alcohol, 30% water).  Isopropyl alcohol is a powerful solvent that can dissolve many types of dirt and grime.  

However, it's important to use it cautiously, as it can damage certain materials.  Always test the solution on an inconspicuous area first.  Apply the solution to a microfiber cloth, not directly to the headphones.  Gently wipe the affected area, then rinse with a clean, damp cloth.  Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scrubbing too hard, as this can scratch the plastic.  If you're dealing with particularly tough stains, you might consider consulting a professional audio equipment cleaner.

## Cable Care: Keeping Your Connection Clean

The cable of your DT 770 Pro headphones is also susceptible to dirt and grime.  Over time, it can accumulate dust, oils, and other contaminants.  To clean the cable, simply wipe it down with a slightly damp microfiber cloth.  

Avoid bending or twisting the cable excessively, as this can damage the internal wires.  If the cable is particularly dirty, you can use a mild soap solution.  Pay attention to the connector end, as this is where dirt tends to accumulate.  You can use a cotton swab dipped in the soap solution to clean the connector.  Ensure the connector is completely dry before plugging it into your audio source.

## Replacing Earpads: When It's Time for an Upgrade

Even with regular cleaning, earpads will eventually wear out.  The foam will compress, the velour or leatherette will crack, and the overall comfort will diminish.  When this happens, it's time to replace the earpads.  

Replacing the earpads is a relatively simple process.  You can purchase replacement earpads online or from audio equipment retailers.  Make sure to choose earpads that are specifically designed for the DT 770 Pro headphones.  Removing the old earpads usually involves gently pulling them off the headphone cups.  Installing the new earpads is just as easy – simply align them with the cups and press them into place.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Can I use disinfectant wipes to clean my DT 770 Pro?**

A: While convenient, disinfectant wipes often contain harsh chemicals that can damage the plastic and earpad materials. It’s best to stick to a slightly damp microfiber cloth with mild soap or a diluted isopropyl alcohol solution.

**Q: How often should I clean my DT 770 Pro headphones?**

A:  It depends on how frequently you use them. A quick wipe-down after each use is ideal. A more thorough cleaning should be done every month or two, or as needed.

A: Avoid abrasive cleaners, strong solvents (like acetone), and excessive moisture.  Never submerge your headphones in water.

**Q:  My earpads are stained, but I don't want to replace them yet. Is there anything I can do?**

A:  For velour, try a specialized fabric cleaner. For leatherette, a diluted isopropyl alcohol solution might help, but test it first.  Prevention is key – wipe down the earpads regularly to prevent stains from setting in.
