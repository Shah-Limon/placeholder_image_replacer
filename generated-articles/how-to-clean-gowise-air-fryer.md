## Keeping it Crispy Clean: How to Clean Your Gowise Air Fryer

Is your Gowise air fryer starting to show the remnants of delicious meals past? Don't worry, a little cleaning goes a long way! A clean air fryer isn’t just more hygienic; it also ensures your food continues to cook evenly and tastes its best. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to keep your Gowise air fryer sparkling, from daily wipe-downs to deep cleaning sessions. We’ll cover all the removable parts and the unit itself, ensuring a thorough clean every time.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning prevents grease buildup.
*   Dish soap and warm water are usually sufficient.
*   Avoid abrasive cleaners that can damage the non-stick coating.
*   Properly drying all components prevents rust and odors.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean a Gowise air fryer, unplug it and allow it to cool completely. Remove the basket and pan, washing them with warm, soapy water. Wipe down the interior and exterior with a damp cloth. For stubborn grease, use a baking soda paste.



## 1. Daily Maintenance: Quick Wipe-Downs for a Happy Air Fryer

After each use, a quick wipe-down is your best friend. This prevents grease and food particles from building up and becoming difficult to remove later. Start by unplugging your Gowise air fryer and letting it cool down completely – safety first! Then, grab a damp cloth or sponge and wipe down the interior of the basket and the pan. You can also wipe down the heating element, but be gentle. 

For the exterior, a simple wipe with a damp cloth will do the trick.  Don't forget to check the crumb tray (if your model has one) and empty it regularly.  Consistent small efforts like these will significantly reduce the need for deep cleaning.  If you're looking for more general advice, check out this guide on [how to clean an air fryer](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-air-fryer) for broader tips.



## 2. Deep Cleaning the Basket and Pan

The basket and pan are the workhorses of your Gowise air fryer, and they require more thorough cleaning. After letting them cool, remove them from the unit. Most Gowise air fryer baskets and pans are dishwasher safe, which makes life easier! However, handwashing is often recommended to preserve the non-stick coating. 

If you choose to handwash, use warm, soapy water and a non-abrasive sponge. Avoid steel wool or harsh scouring pads, as these can scratch the surface. For stubborn, stuck-on food, let the basket and pan soak in warm, soapy water for 10-15 minutes before scrubbing.  If you have a particularly tough mess, consider this guide on [how to clean air fryer racks](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-air-fryer-racks) for more advanced techniques.



## 3. Tackling Stubborn Grease and Food Residue

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, grease and food residue can stubbornly cling to your Gowise air fryer.  Don't reach for harsh chemicals! A simple baking soda paste is a surprisingly effective solution. Mix baking soda with a small amount of water to create a paste. 

Apply the paste to the affected areas and let it sit for 15-20 minutes. Then, gently scrub with a non-abrasive sponge. The baking soda will help to loosen the grime, making it easier to remove.  Rinse thoroughly with warm water and dry completely.  For a similar approach on other brands, see [how to clean a Ninja air fryer oven](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-ninja-air-fryer-oven).



## 4. Cleaning the Air Fryer Unit Itself

While the basket and pan get the most attention, don't neglect the air fryer unit itself. Unplug the appliance and ensure it’s completely cool. Use a damp (not wet!) cloth to wipe down the exterior. 

For the interior, you can use a damp cloth with a little dish soap. Be careful not to get any water into the heating element or the electrical components.  Avoid spraying cleaning solutions directly into the unit; instead, spray them onto the cloth first. Pay attention to any vents or openings, as these can accumulate grease and dust.



## 5. Dealing with the Heating Element

The heating element is crucial for your air fryer’s performance, so it needs gentle care. Never submerge the heating element in water. Instead, use a soft brush or a damp cloth to carefully remove any loose food particles or grease. 

You can also use a cotton swab dipped in a little white vinegar to clean hard-to-reach areas.  Be sure to dry the heating element thoroughly before using the air fryer again.  If you're concerned about damaging the element, consider consulting the Gowise user manual for specific cleaning instructions.



## 6. Preventing Odors and Maintaining Freshness

Over time, air fryers can develop unpleasant odors.  To prevent this, ensure all components are completely dry after cleaning. Leaving moisture inside can lead to mold and mildew growth.  

You can also place an open box of baking soda inside the air fryer when it’s not in use to absorb odors.  Another trick is to run the air fryer empty for a few minutes at a high temperature. This can help to burn off any lingering smells.  If you're struggling with odors in other appliances, you might find this article on [how to clean a Farberware deep fryer](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-farber-ware-deep-fryer) helpful.



## 7. Long-Term Care and Maintenance Tips

To keep your Gowise air fryer in top condition for years to come, follow these long-term care tips. Regularly check the power cord for any signs of damage. If the cord is frayed or damaged, discontinue use and contact Gowise customer support. 

Avoid using abrasive cleaners or metal utensils, as these can damage the non-stick coating.  Store your air fryer in a clean, dry place when not in use.  Finally, refer to your Gowise air fryer’s user manual for specific cleaning and maintenance recommendations.



## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

A: No, absolutely not. Bleach is a harsh chemical that can damage the non-stick coating and potentially release harmful fumes. Stick to mild dish soap and warm water, or a baking soda paste for stubborn stains.

**Q: How often should I deep clean my Gowise air fryer?**

A: It depends on how often you use it. Generally, a deep clean every 1-2 months is sufficient. However, if you use your air fryer frequently, you may need to deep clean it more often.

**Q: My air fryer basket is heavily stained. Can I restore it?**

A: While you may not be able to completely restore a heavily stained basket, soaking it overnight in a solution of warm water and dish soap can help to lighten the stains. You can also try using a baking soda paste.

**Q: Is it safe to put the Gowise air fryer parts in the dishwasher?**

A: Most Gowise air fryer baskets and pans are dishwasher safe, but it’s always best to check your user manual to confirm. Handwashing is generally recommended to prolong the life of the non-stick coating.

**Q: What if food is really stuck to the bottom of the pan?**

A: Try boiling water in the pan for a few minutes. This can help to loosen the stuck-on food. Then, let it cool slightly before scrubbing with a non-abrasive sponge.
