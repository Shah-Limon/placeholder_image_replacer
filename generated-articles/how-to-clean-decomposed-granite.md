## Keeping Your Landscape Beautiful: How To Clean Decomposed Granite

Have you noticed your beautiful decomposed granite (DG) pathway or patio looking a little dull or stained? Don't worry, it's a common issue! Decomposed granite, while a fantastic landscaping material, *does* require some maintenance to keep it looking its best. This article will walk you through everything you need to know about cleaning decomposed granite, from routine upkeep to tackling stubborn stains. We’ll cover the best tools, techniques, and preventative measures to ensure your DG surfaces remain attractive for years to come. Let's get started and restore the natural beauty of your outdoor spaces.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular sweeping and rinsing are key to preventing buildup.
*   Mild dish soap and water are effective for general cleaning.
*   Address oil stains immediately with absorbent materials.
*   Re-leveling DG is sometimes necessary after heavy cleaning or rain.

**What is the best way to clean decomposed granite?**

The best way to clean decomposed granite involves regular sweeping to remove debris, occasional rinsing with water, and spot-treating stains with mild dish soap. Avoid harsh chemicals and power washing, as these can damage the material and wash away the binding properties.

## Understanding Decomposed Granite & Cleaning Challenges

Decomposed granite is created by weathering granite into a fine, gravel-like material. It’s a popular choice for pathways, patios, and driveways because of its natural look and permeability. However, its loose composition also means it’s prone to collecting dirt, dust, leaves, and other debris.  This buildup can lead to discoloration and compaction, reducing its permeability.  Regular cleaning is essential to prevent these issues and maintain the DG’s aesthetic appeal.  Understanding the material’s properties will help you choose the right cleaning methods.

## Routine Maintenance: Sweeping and Rinsing

The simplest and most effective way to keep your decomposed granite clean is through regular maintenance.  Sweeping the surface at least once a week removes loose debris like leaves, twigs, and dirt. This prevents these materials from being ground into the DG, causing staining or compaction.  For a deeper clean, occasionally rinse the area with a garden hose.  Avoid using a high-pressure nozzle, as this can displace the DG.  A gentle spray is all you need to wash away surface dirt and dust.  Think of it like giving your DG a refreshing drink!

## Tackling Oil and Grease Stains on Decomposed Granite

Oil and grease stains are among the most challenging to remove from decomposed granite.  These substances penetrate the porous material quickly, making them difficult to lift.  The key is to act fast! Immediately blot up as much of the oil as possible with absorbent materials like paper towels, kitty litter, or cornstarch.  Let the absorbent material sit for several hours, or even overnight, to draw out the oil.  Then, sweep it away.  For stubborn stains, create a paste of baking soda and water, apply it to the stain, and let it dry completely before sweeping.  If the stain persists, you may need to consider replacing the affected DG.

## Cleaning Decomposed Granite with Soap and Water

For general cleaning beyond sweeping and rinsing, a mild solution of dish soap and water is your best bet.  Mix a small amount of dish soap (about a tablespoon) with a gallon of water.  Gently scrub the DG surface with a stiff-bristled brush, working in circular motions.  Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the DG and potentially harm surrounding plants.  After scrubbing, thoroughly rinse the area with clean water to remove all traces of soap.  Ensure the water drains properly to prevent further staining.

## Dealing with Organic Stains: Leaves, Berries, and More

Organic stains, such as those from fallen leaves, berries, or bird droppings, can also discolor decomposed granite.  These stains are often easier to remove than oil stains, but prompt action is still important.  Start by removing any remaining organic matter.  Then, scrub the area with a solution of mild dish soap and water, as described above.  For more stubborn stains, you can try a solution of white vinegar and water (1 part vinegar to 3 parts water).  Apply the solution to the stain, let it sit for 10-15 minutes, and then scrub and rinse thoroughly.  Always test any cleaning solution in an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn't damage the DG.

## Re-Leveling and Compacting Decomposed Granite

Over time, and especially after heavy cleaning or rainfall, decomposed granite can become uneven or compacted.  This can create ruts and depressions, making the surface less attractive and potentially hazardous.  To re-level the DG, use a rake to redistribute the material, filling in low spots.  You may need to add more DG to areas that have significantly settled.  After re-leveling, compact the surface with a hand tamper or a plate compactor.  Compacting helps to create a firm, stable surface and prevents the DG from shifting around.  Proper compaction is crucial for maintaining the longevity and appearance of your DG pathway or patio.

## FAQ About Cleaning Decomposed Granite

**Q: Can I use a pressure washer on decomposed granite?**

A: No, avoid using a pressure washer. The high pressure can displace the DG, wash away the binding properties, and create an uneven surface. A gentle garden hose spray is much safer and more effective.

**Q: How often should I clean decomposed granite?**

A: Regular sweeping is recommended weekly. A more thorough cleaning with soap and water should be done every few months, or as needed based on usage and environmental factors.

**Q: What's the best way to prevent stains on decomposed granite?**

A: Promptly clean up spills, especially oil and grease. Consider sealing the DG with a stabilizer to help prevent staining and compaction.

**Q: Will sealing decomposed granite change its appearance?**

A: Some sealants may slightly darken the DG, while others are designed to be clear. Always test the sealant in an inconspicuous area first to ensure you like the results.

**Q: Can I use bleach to clean decomposed granite?**

A: Avoid using bleach. It can discolor the DG and harm surrounding plants. Mild dish soap and water are a much safer and more effective option.
