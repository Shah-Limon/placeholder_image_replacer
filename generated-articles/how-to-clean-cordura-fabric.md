## How to Clean Cordura Fabric: A Complete Guide

Is your favorite backpack looking a little worse for wear? Perhaps your Cordura jacket has picked up some grime from your latest adventure? Cordura fabric is known for its incredible durability, but even the toughest materials need a little TLC. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about how to clean Cordura fabric, keeping it functional and looking great for years to come. We’ll cover everything from quick spot treatments to more thorough cleaning methods.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular brushing removes loose dirt.
*   Mild soap and water are best for most cleaning.
*   Avoid harsh chemicals and high heat.
*   Air drying is crucial to maintain fabric integrity.

**What is Cordura Fabric and Why Does it Need Cleaning?**

Cordura is a family of textured nylon fabrics known for their exceptional strength and abrasion resistance. It’s commonly used in luggage, backpacks, outerwear, and even upholstery. While incredibly durable, Cordura isn’t immune to dirt, stains, and general wear and tear. Cleaning Cordura fabric regularly prevents dirt from becoming embedded, preserving its water-repellent properties and extending its lifespan. Keeping it clean also maintains its appearance, ensuring your gear looks as good as it performs.

### Understanding Cordura Fabric Types

Before diving into cleaning, it’s helpful to understand that Cordura comes in different weights and finishes. The most common types include Cordura 500D and Cordura 1000D, with the “D” representing denier (thread thickness). Higher denier fabrics are heavier and more durable. Some Cordura fabrics also have a water-repellent coating. Knowing your fabric type will help you choose the appropriate cleaning method. For example, a heavily coated fabric might require extra care to avoid stripping the coating.

### Quick Spot Cleaning for Cordura

Sometimes, a full clean isn’t necessary. For small stains or dirt marks, spot cleaning is a quick and effective solution. Start by gently brushing away any loose debris with a soft-bristled brush. Then, mix a small amount of mild liquid soap (like dish soap) with lukewarm water. Dip a clean cloth into the soapy water, wring it out well, and gently blot the stain. Avoid rubbing vigorously, as this can damage the fabric. Finally, rinse the area with clean water and allow it to air dry.

### Deep Cleaning Cordura: Hand Washing Method

For a more thorough clean, hand washing is the preferred method. Fill a basin or sink with lukewarm water and add a small amount of mild detergent. Submerge the Cordura item and gently agitate the water to loosen dirt and grime. Avoid harsh scrubbing, which can damage the fabric’s fibers. Let the item soak for 15-30 minutes, then rinse thoroughly with clean water until all traces of soap are gone. Gently squeeze out excess water – do *not* wring the fabric.

### Machine Washing Cordura (With Caution!)

While hand washing is recommended, some Cordura items can be machine washed. However, proceed with caution! Always check the care label first. If machine washing is permitted, use a front-loading washing machine on a gentle cycle with cold water. Use a mild detergent and avoid bleach or fabric softeners. Place the item in a mesh laundry bag to protect it from abrasion. After washing, skip the dryer!

### Drying Cordura Fabric Properly

Proper drying is crucial for maintaining the integrity of Cordura fabric. *Never* put Cordura in the dryer, as the high heat can damage the fibers and potentially melt any coatings. Instead, allow the item to air dry completely in a well-ventilated area. Lay it flat on a clean surface or hang it on a clothesline, avoiding direct sunlight. Direct sunlight can cause fading. Ensure the item is completely dry before storing it to prevent mildew growth.

### Removing Stubborn Stains from Cordura

Sometimes, mild soap and water aren’t enough. For stubborn stains, you may need to try a specialized stain remover. Always test the stain remover on an inconspicuous area of the fabric first to ensure it doesn’t cause discoloration. Apply the stain remover according to the product instructions, and gently blot the stain with a clean cloth. Rinse thoroughly with clean water and allow to air dry. For oil-based stains, a degreasing dish soap can be effective.
