## Keeping Your Air Dry: How to Clean a GE Dehumidifier

Is your GE dehumidifier working harder than it should? A little regular cleaning can go a long way in maintaining its efficiency and ensuring the air in your home stays fresh and dry.  This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to properly clean your GE dehumidifier, from the filter to the coils, and help you breathe easier. We’ll cover the steps to keep it running smoothly and prevent mold growth. Let's dive in and learn how to keep your dehumidifier in top shape!

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly clean the filter (every 2 weeks) to maintain airflow.
*   Clean the coils (every 3-6 months) for optimal performance.
*   Disinfect the water tank to prevent mold and bacteria.
*   Keep the exterior clean for a longer lifespan.

**Quick Answer:** To clean a GE dehumidifier, start by unplugging it. Remove and clean the filter every two weeks. Clean the coils every 3-6 months with a vacuum and brush. Empty and disinfect the water tank regularly to prevent mold.



## 1. Why Cleaning Your GE Dehumidifier Matters

Cleaning your GE dehumidifier isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about performance and health. Dust and debris accumulate quickly, reducing airflow and forcing the unit to work harder. This increased effort leads to higher energy bills and a shorter lifespan for your appliance.  Furthermore, a dirty dehumidifier can become a breeding ground for mold and bacteria, releasing harmful particles into the air you breathe.  Regular cleaning ensures your dehumidifier operates efficiently, saves you money, and contributes to a healthier home environment. 

## 2. Gathering Your Cleaning Supplies

Before you begin, gather everything you’ll need to make the cleaning process smooth and effective. You won’t need anything fancy, just a few common household items.  Here’s a checklist:

*   Screwdriver (Phillips head, for accessing internal components)
*   Vacuum cleaner with brush attachment
*   Soft brush (old toothbrush works well)
*   Mild detergent or coil cleaner
*   Disinfectant (bleach solution – 1 tablespoon bleach per gallon of water)
*   Clean cloths or sponges
*   Water

Having these supplies ready will streamline the process and ensure you can tackle each step efficiently.  If you're looking for more general dehumidifier cleaning tips, you can find them [here](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-dehumidifier).



## 3. Cleaning the GE Dehumidifier Filter

The filter is the first line of defense against dust and particles, and it requires the most frequent attention. A clogged filter restricts airflow, making the dehumidifier work harder.  Most GE dehumidifiers have a removable filter located on the front or side of the unit.  

Here’s how to clean it:

1.  **Unplug the dehumidifier.** Safety first!
2.  **Remove the filter.**  Consult your owner’s manual if you’re unsure how to do this.
3.  **Vacuum the filter.** Use the brush attachment to remove loose dust and debris.
4.  **Wash the filter.** Rinse the filter with lukewarm water and a mild detergent.
5.  **Dry the filter completely.** Allow the filter to air dry completely before reinstalling it.  Never put a wet filter back into the dehumidifier.
6.  **Reinstall the filter.**

Aim to clean the filter every two weeks for optimal performance.



## 4. Cleaning the Dehumidifier Coils

The coils are responsible for cooling the air and removing moisture. Over time, they accumulate dust, reducing their efficiency. Cleaning the coils is a bit more involved but crucial for maintaining optimal performance.

1.  **Unplug the dehumidifier.** Again, safety first!
2.  **Access the coils.** This usually involves removing the outer casing of the dehumidifier. Refer to your owner’s manual for specific instructions.
3.  **Vacuum the coils.** Use the brush attachment to gently remove dust and debris from the coils. Be careful not to bend or damage the delicate fins.
4.  **Use coil cleaner (optional).** If the coils are heavily soiled, you can use a commercially available coil cleaner. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully.
5.  **Reassemble the dehumidifier.** Once the coils are clean and dry, reassemble the outer casing.

Clean the coils every 3-6 months, depending on usage and dust levels.



## 5. Disinfecting the Water Tank

The water tank collects condensation, which can become a breeding ground for mold and bacteria. Regularly disinfecting the tank prevents unpleasant odors and ensures the air remains clean.  

1.  **Empty the water tank.**
2.  **Prepare a disinfectant solution.** Mix 1 tablespoon of bleach with 1 gallon of water.
3.  **Fill the tank with the solution.**
4.  **Let it sit for 30 minutes.**
5.  **Empty the tank and rinse thoroughly with clean water.**
6.  **Dry the tank completely before reinstalling.**

Disinfect the water tank every month, or more frequently if you notice any signs of mold or mildew.



## 6. Cleaning the Exterior and Interior

Don’t forget to clean the exterior and interior surfaces of your GE dehumidifier. Dust and grime can accumulate on the cabinet and internal components.  

1.  **Unplug the dehumidifier.**
2.  **Wipe down the exterior.** Use a damp cloth with mild detergent to wipe down the cabinet.
3.  **Clean the interior.** Use a damp cloth to wipe down the interior surfaces, being careful not to get water on any electrical components.
4.  **Dry all surfaces thoroughly.**

Regularly wiping down the exterior will keep your dehumidifier looking its best, while cleaning the interior helps prevent mold and mildew growth.



## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

Sometimes, even with regular cleaning, you might encounter issues with your GE dehumidifier. Here are a few common problems and how to address them:

*   **Dehumidifier isn’t collecting water:** Check the filter, coils, and temperature settings. Ensure the unit isn’t placed too close to a wall or other obstruction.
*   **Dehumidifier is making strange noises:** Check for loose parts or debris inside the unit.
*   **Dehumidifier smells musty:** Disinfect the water tank and clean the coils.

If you’re unable to resolve the issue, consult your owner’s manual or contact a qualified appliance repair technician.  If you have a Whirlpool dehumidifier, you can find specific filter cleaning instructions [here](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-whirlpool-dehumidifier-filter).
