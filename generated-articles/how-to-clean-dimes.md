## Understanding Dime Composition & Cleaning Considerations

Dimes have changed in composition over the years, impacting how you should clean them. From 1964 and earlier, dimes were made of 90% silver and 10% copper. These silver dimes, often called “Mercury dimes” or “Roosevelt dimes” depending on the year, require a slightly different approach than those made after 1965. Post-1965 dimes are clad – meaning they have a copper core with layers of nickel and copper. Knowing the composition is the first step to cleaning dimes properly. 

Understanding the metal composition helps you choose the right cleaning method. Silver dimes benefit from cleaners specifically designed for silver, while clad dimes can usually be cleaned with milder solutions.  Always test any cleaning solution on a less valuable dime first to ensure it doesn't cause discoloration or damage.  If you're unsure about a dime's value, it's best to err on the side of caution and avoid aggressive cleaning.  For valuable coins, consider consulting a numismatist (coin expert) before attempting any cleaning.

## Gentle Cleaning: Soap and Water for Everyday Dimes

For everyday, non-collectible dimes, a simple soap and water solution is often all you need. This method is safe for both silver and clad dimes and won’t cause any damage. Start by filling a bowl with lukewarm water and adding a few drops of mild dish soap. Gently swirl the dimes in the soapy water for a few minutes, using your fingers to loosen any dirt or grime. 

Avoid using abrasive sponges or cloths, as these can scratch the coin's surface. A soft toothbrush can be helpful for reaching into crevices. Once the dimes are clean, rinse them thoroughly with distilled water to remove all traces of soap.  Distilled water is preferred because it doesn’t contain minerals that can leave water spots.  Finally, pat the dimes dry with a soft, lint-free cloth.  This simple method is a great starting point for cleaning most dimes.

## Removing Tarnishing: Baking Soda Paste for Silver Dimes

Silver dimes are prone to tarnishing, a dark discoloration caused by a reaction with sulfur in the air. Baking soda paste is a gentle yet effective way to remove tarnish from silver dimes. Mix baking soda with a small amount of water to create a paste. Apply the paste to the dime and gently rub it in a circular motion with a soft cloth. 

Don't scrub too hard, as this can cause scratches. Let the paste sit on the dime for a few minutes, then rinse thoroughly with distilled water.  Again, distilled water is key to preventing water spots.  For stubborn tarnish, you can add a few drops of white vinegar to the baking soda paste, but use this sparingly as vinegar is mildly acidic.  After rinsing, dry the dime immediately with a soft, lint-free cloth.  This method is best suited for silver dimes and should be used cautiously on clad dimes.

## Specialized Silver Cleaners: For Valuable Silver Dimes

For valuable silver dimes, or for a more thorough cleaning, consider using a commercially available silver cleaner. These cleaners are specifically formulated to remove tarnish and restore the shine of silver without causing damage. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully. 

Typically, you'll apply a small amount of cleaner to a soft cloth and gently rub it onto the dime. Avoid immersing the dime in the cleaner, as this can lead to over-cleaning and potential damage. Rinse the dime thoroughly with distilled water after cleaning and dry it immediately with a soft, lint-free cloth.  Be sure to choose a silver cleaner that is specifically designed for coins, as some cleaners contain abrasive ingredients that can harm the coin's surface.

## Avoiding Common Mistakes When Cleaning Dimes

Cleaning dimes isn't always straightforward, and there are several common mistakes to avoid. Never use abrasive cleaners like scouring powders or steel wool, as these will scratch the coin's surface and significantly reduce its value. Avoid harsh chemicals like bleach or ammonia, as these can damage the metal. 

Don't rub the dimes together, as this can also cause scratches. Always rinse the dimes thoroughly with distilled water to remove all traces of cleaning solution.  And most importantly, don't attempt to clean valuable or rare dimes without consulting a numismatist.  Remember, cleaning can sometimes decrease a coin's value, so proceed with caution.

## Drying and Storage: Protecting Your Cleaned Dimes

Proper drying and storage are crucial for maintaining the shine of your cleaned dimes. After rinsing, pat the dimes dry with a soft, lint-free cloth.  Avoid air drying, as this can lead to water spots.  For silver dimes, you can use a silver polishing cloth to further enhance the shine. 

Store the dimes in a clean, dry place, away from direct sunlight and humidity. Coin holders or albums are ideal for protecting the dimes from scratches and tarnishing.  Avoid storing dimes in plastic bags, as these can trap moisture and promote corrosion.  Proper storage will help preserve the beauty of your cleaned dimes for years to come.
