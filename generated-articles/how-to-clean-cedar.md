## How to Clean Cedar: A Complete Guide

Have you ever opened a cedar chest and inhaled that wonderfully fresh, natural scent? Cedar is prized for its aromatic qualities and ability to repel moths, but even this beautiful wood needs cleaning. This article will show you exactly how to clean cedar, whether it’s a chest, siding, furniture, or other items, keeping it looking and smelling its best. We’ll cover everything from gentle dusting to tackling tougher grime, ensuring your cedar remains a cherished part of your home.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular dusting prevents buildup.
*   Mild soap and water are usually sufficient for cleaning.
*   Avoid harsh chemicals that can damage the wood or remove the scent.
*   Proper drying is crucial to prevent mold and mildew.

**Quick Answer:**

To clean cedar, gently dust it regularly. For deeper cleaning, mix mild dish soap with warm water, apply with a soft cloth, and wipe down the surface. Rinse with a clean, damp cloth and dry thoroughly. Avoid harsh chemicals to preserve the wood’s natural oils and fragrance.

## Why Cleaning Cedar Matters

Cedar wood is naturally resistant to decay and insects thanks to its oils. However, dust, dirt, and grime can accumulate over time, diminishing its appearance and potentially clogging the wood’s pores. Cleaning cedar isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about maintaining its protective qualities and preserving that signature aroma. A clean cedar surface will continue to release its natural oils, keeping moths away from your clothes and adding a pleasant scent to your space. 

## Dusting and Regular Maintenance for Cedar

The easiest way to keep your cedar items clean is through regular dusting. Dusting prevents the buildup of dirt and grime, which can be harder to remove later. Use a soft, dry cloth to wipe down cedar surfaces weekly. For intricate carvings or hard-to-reach areas, a soft brush attachment on your vacuum cleaner can be very effective.  Consider using a microfiber cloth, as these trap dust effectively without scratching the wood.

## Cleaning Cedar Furniture: A Gentle Approach

Cedar furniture, like chests or closets, requires a bit more care than simply dusting. Start by vacuuming the furniture to remove loose debris. Then, prepare a cleaning solution of warm water and a few drops of mild dish soap. Dip a soft cloth into the solution, wring it out thoroughly, and gently wipe down the cedar surface. Avoid soaking the wood, as excessive moisture can cause damage.  

### Dealing with Stubborn Stains on Cedar Furniture

If you encounter stubborn stains on your cedar furniture, avoid abrasive cleaners. Instead, try making a paste of baking soda and water. Apply the paste to the stain, let it sit for a few minutes, and then gently rub it with a soft cloth. Rinse with a clean, damp cloth and dry immediately. For particularly difficult stains, you might consider consulting a professional furniture restorer.

## Cleaning Cedar Siding: Exterior Care

Cedar siding adds beautiful curb appeal to your home, but it’s exposed to the elements. Cleaning cedar siding removes dirt, mildew, and algae, protecting the wood and maintaining its appearance. Start by rinsing the siding with a garden hose to remove loose debris. Then, mix a solution of water and a mild detergent specifically designed for wood. Apply the solution with a soft brush, working from the bottom up. Rinse thoroughly with clean water.

### Preventing Mildew on Cedar Siding

Mildew is a common problem on cedar siding, especially in humid climates. To prevent mildew growth, ensure proper ventilation around your home. Trim bushes and trees that block airflow. You can also apply a mildew-resistant wood preservative to help protect the siding. Regular cleaning, as described above, will also help prevent mildew from taking hold.

## Cleaning a Cedar Chest: Preserving the Aroma

Cedar chests are prized for their moth-repelling properties, but they need occasional cleaning to maintain their effectiveness.  Empty the chest completely and vacuum the interior to remove any dust or debris.  Then, wipe down the interior surfaces with a slightly damp cloth. Avoid using harsh chemicals or strong detergents, as these can strip the cedar of its natural oils.  

### Restoring the Cedar Scent

Over time, the cedar scent in a chest can fade. To restore the aroma, lightly sand the interior surfaces with fine-grit sandpaper. This will expose fresh cedar wood and release the oils. You can also purchase cedar blocks or sachets to place inside the chest, further enhancing the scent.

## Drying Cedar Properly After Cleaning

Proper drying is crucial after cleaning cedar.  Excess moisture can lead to warping, cracking, or even mold growth.  Use a clean, dry cloth to thoroughly wipe down all surfaces.  Allow the cedar to air dry completely in a well-ventilated area.  Avoid placing cedar items in direct sunlight or near heat sources, as this can also cause damage.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Cleaning Cedar

**Q: Can I use bleach to clean cedar?**
A: No, bleach is too harsh for cedar and can damage the wood, stripping it of its natural oils and fragrance. Stick to mild soap and water for cleaning.

**Q: How often should I clean my cedar chest?**
A: Clean your cedar chest at least once a year, or more often if it’s heavily used. Regular dusting will help keep it clean between deep cleanings.

**Q: Will cleaning remove the cedar scent?**
A: Gentle cleaning with mild soap and water shouldn’t remove the scent entirely. However, if the scent fades, you can lightly sand the wood or add cedar blocks.

**Q: What’s the best way to clean cedar siding that has a lot of mildew?**
A: For heavy mildew, you may need a specialized wood cleaner designed to remove mildew. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions and test the cleaner in an inconspicuous area first.

**Q: Can I use furniture polish on cedar furniture?**
A: Avoid using silicone-based furniture polishes on cedar. These can build up on the wood and prevent it from breathing. If you want to polish your cedar furniture, use a natural beeswax polish.

Cleaning cedar is a straightforward process that helps preserve its beauty, protective qualities, and signature aroma. By following these simple guidelines – regular dusting, gentle cleaning with mild soap and water, and proper drying – you can keep your cedar items looking and smelling their best for years to come.
