## Cleaning Distributor Points: A Step-by-Step Guide

Is your classic car running rough? One often-overlooked culprit could be dirty distributor points. These small but vital components are essential for a properly functioning ignition system. Cleaning distributor points is a relatively simple maintenance task that can significantly improve your engine’s performance. This article will walk you through everything you need to know about cleaning distributor points, from the tools required to the step-by-step process and troubleshooting tips.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regularly cleaning distributor points improves ignition timing.
*   Proper cleaning ensures efficient spark delivery.
*   This maintenance task can restore engine performance.

**What are distributor points and why clean them?**

Distributor points are part of the ignition system in older vehicles. They open and close a circuit, creating the spark that ignites the air-fuel mixture in your engine. Over time, these points accumulate corrosion and carbon buildup from the arcing electricity. This buildup interferes with their ability to make clean contact, leading to a weak spark, misfires, and reduced engine performance. Cleaning them restores that clean contact, ensuring a strong, consistent spark.

## Tools You’ll Need for Distributor Point Cleaning

Before you begin, gather the necessary tools. Having everything ready will make the process smoother and more efficient. You won’t need anything overly specialized, which makes this a great DIY project. 

Here’s what you’ll need:

*   **Distributor wrench:** This specialized wrench is designed to access the distributor hold-down bolt.
*   **Points file or business card:** A dedicated points file is ideal, but a clean, thick business card can work in a pinch. Avoid sandpaper, as it can leave abrasive particles.
*   **Contact cleaner:** Specifically formulated for electrical contacts, this spray removes oil, grease, and corrosion.
*   **Screwdriver:** For removing the distributor cap and adjusting the points.
*   **Feeler gauge:** Used to accurately set the point gap after cleaning.
*   **Shop towels:** For wiping away dirt and cleaner.
*   **Gloves:** To protect your hands.

## Accessing the Distributor Points

First, you need to access the distributor points. This involves removing the distributor cap. Locate the distributor, usually on the engine block. Carefully remove the distributor cap, noting its orientation for reinstallation. Disconnect the coil wire from the distributor cap and label it if necessary. Now you’ll be able to see the distributor points underneath. Take a moment to observe their condition – are they heavily pitted or corroded? This will give you an idea of how much cleaning is needed.

## The Cleaning Process: Step-by-Step

Now for the core of the task: cleaning the distributor points. This is a delicate process, so take your time.

1.  **Secure the points:** Use a screwdriver to gently hold the moving point arm open. This prevents damage to the points during cleaning.
2.  **File the points:** Using a points file or business card, gently file the contact surfaces of both the stationary and moving points. Work in one direction only, avoiding back-and-forth motions. This removes the corrosion and buildup.
3.  **Spray with contact cleaner:** Apply a generous amount of contact cleaner to the points, ensuring it reaches all contact surfaces. This dissolves any remaining residue.
4.  **Wipe clean:** Use a clean shop towel to wipe away the cleaner and loosened debris.
5.  **Repeat if necessary:** If the points were heavily corroded, repeat steps 2-4 until the surfaces are clean and shiny.

## Setting the Point Gap

Cleaning the points is only half the battle. You must also set the correct point gap for optimal performance. The correct gap varies depending on your vehicle’s make and model, so consult your service manual. 

1.  **Loosen the adjustment screw:** Locate the adjustment screw on the distributor. Loosen it enough to allow movement of the points.
2.  **Insert the feeler gauge:** Insert the appropriate size feeler gauge between the points.
3.  **Adjust the gap:** Tighten the adjustment screw until the feeler gauge slides with a slight drag.
4.  **Re-check:** Remove the feeler gauge and re-check the gap to ensure accuracy.

Properly setting the point gap is crucial for timing and engine efficiency. If you're unsure, it's best to consult a qualified mechanic. Maintaining your vehicle's ignition system is important, and sometimes you need to consider other components like the [carburetor](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-carburetor) to ensure optimal performance.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

Even after cleaning and adjusting, you might encounter issues. Here are a few common problems and their solutions:

*   **Continued misfires:** If misfires persist, the points may be worn beyond repair and need replacement.
*   **Burning smell:** A burning smell could indicate the points are too close together, causing them to stay closed for too long. Re-check and adjust the gap.
*   **Difficulty starting:** Difficulty starting can be caused by a variety of factors, but dirty or improperly gapped points are often a contributing factor.
*   **Points closing too quickly:** This can be caused by a worn distributor cam or a faulty condenser.

## Maintaining Your Distributor Points

Cleaning distributor points isn’t a one-time fix. Regular maintenance is key to keeping your ignition system in top shape. Check and clean your points every 6,000-12,000 miles, or as recommended in your vehicle’s service manual. Regular inspection can prevent more serious issues down the road. Consider the overall cleanliness of your engine bay; keeping it free of dirt and grime can help prolong the life of all components. You might also want to consider cleaning other parts of your vehicle, like the [boat](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-boat) if you have one.



## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How often should I clean my distributor points?**

A: It’s generally recommended to clean your distributor points every 6,000 to 12,000 miles, or annually. However, the frequency depends on driving conditions and the age of the points. Regular inspection is key.

**Q: Can I use sandpaper to clean distributor points?**

A: No, avoid using sandpaper. Sandpaper is too abrasive and can leave particles that interfere with the points’ contact. Use a points file or a clean business card instead.

**Q: What does the point gap do?**

A: The point gap determines how long the points remain closed, which directly affects the ignition timing. An incorrect gap can lead to misfires, reduced power, and poor fuel economy.

**Q: What if my points are badly pitted?**

A: If the points are heavily pitted, cleaning may not be enough. In this case, it’s best to replace the points with a new set.

**Q: Is cleaning distributor points a difficult task?**

A: No, cleaning distributor points is a relatively simple task that most DIY mechanics can handle. However, it requires patience and attention to detail.



## Conclusion

Cleaning distributor points is a valuable maintenance task for owners of classic cars with traditional ignition systems. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can restore your engine’s performance and enjoy a smoother, more reliable driving experience. Remember to use the correct tools, take your time, and double-check your work. Regularly cleaning your distributor points, along with other routine maintenance, will help keep your vehicle running strong for years to come.
