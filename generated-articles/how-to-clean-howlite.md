## Keeping Calm & Cleaning On: How To Clean Howlite

Have you noticed your beautiful howlite stone looking a little dull? Don't worry, it happens! Howlite, known for its calming energy and often mimicking other stones like turquoise, requires gentle cleaning to maintain its luster. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about cleaning howlite, ensuring it stays a beautiful and peaceful addition to your collection. We’ll cover safe methods, what to avoid, and how to keep your howlite looking its best. Let's dive in and learn how to clean howlite effectively.

**Takeaway:**

*   Use a soft cloth and mild soap with lukewarm water.
*   Avoid harsh chemicals, ultrasonic cleaners, and prolonged water exposure.
*   Dry thoroughly with a soft cloth after cleaning.
*   Polish gently to restore shine.

**Quick Answer:** To clean howlite, gently wipe it with a soft cloth dampened with lukewarm water and a mild soap. Rinse thoroughly and dry immediately. Avoid harsh chemicals and prolonged soaking, as howlite is porous and can be damaged.

## Understanding Howlite & Its Cleaning Needs

Howlite is a borate mineral, often white with grey or black veining. It’s a relatively soft stone, ranking around 3.5 on the Mohs hardness scale. This means it’s more susceptible to scratches and damage than harder gemstones. Because of its porous nature, howlite can easily absorb oils and dirt, making regular cleaning important. Understanding these properties is key to choosing the right cleaning methods. You want to preserve the stone’s natural beauty and avoid any damage during the cleaning process.  Proper care will ensure your howlite continues to radiate its peaceful energy.

## Gentle Cleaning: The Best Method for Howlite

The safest and most effective way to clean howlite is with a gentle approach. Start by gathering your supplies: a soft cloth (microfiber is ideal), lukewarm water, and a mild soap – dish soap works well.  Dip the cloth into the soapy water, ensuring it’s damp, not soaking wet. Gently wipe the howlite stone, paying attention to any areas with visible dirt or grime. Rinse the stone thoroughly under lukewarm water to remove all traces of soap. Finally, dry the howlite immediately with a clean, soft cloth.  This method is perfect for regular maintenance and keeping your howlite looking its best.

## What to Avoid When Cleaning Howlite

Certain cleaning methods can actually harm your howlite. Avoid using harsh chemicals like bleach, ammonia, or strong detergents. These can discolor or damage the stone’s surface.  Also, steer clear of ultrasonic cleaners, as the vibrations can cause fractures. Prolonged exposure to water should also be avoided, as howlite is porous and can absorb water, potentially leading to damage.

Remember, gentle is always best when it comes to howlite.

## Polishing Howlite for Extra Shine

After cleaning, you can gently polish your howlite to restore its shine. Use a clean, dry, soft cloth and rub the stone in circular motions. This will help to remove any remaining residue and enhance its natural luster. Avoid using abrasive polishing compounds, as these can scratch the surface.  A little bit of polishing can go a long way in making your howlite look brand new.

## Cleaning Howlite Jewelry: Special Considerations

Cleaning howlite jewelry requires a bit more care, especially if the howlite is set in metal.  When cleaning howlite jewelry, avoid getting the metal wet for extended periods, especially if it's a delicate metal like silver.  Use the same gentle cleaning method as described above, but be extra careful around the setting. You can use a soft toothbrush to gently clean around the metal prongs, but avoid applying too much pressure.  If your jewelry has intricate details, consider using a cotton swab dipped in soapy water to reach those hard-to-reach areas.

## Storing Howlite to Prevent Future Cleaning

Proper storage can significantly reduce the frequency of cleaning needed. Store your howlite stones or jewelry in a soft pouch or wrapped in a soft cloth to protect them from scratches and dust. Keep them away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures, as these can cause discoloration. Avoid storing howlite with harder gemstones, as they could potentially scratch the surface.  A little preventative care can save you time and effort in the long run.  Thinking about overall home care?
