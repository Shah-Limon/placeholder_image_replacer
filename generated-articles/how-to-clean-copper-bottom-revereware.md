## Understanding Your Copper Bottom Revereware

Revereware with a copper bottom is prized for its even heat distribution, making it a favorite among chefs and home cooks alike. The copper layer conducts heat quickly and efficiently, while the stainless steel interior provides durability and ease of cleaning. However, the copper *will* tarnish over time, and improper cleaning can damage the finish. Knowing the materials you’re working with is the first step to keeping your cookware in top condition. Understanding the composition helps you choose the right cleaning methods.

## Daily Cleaning: Maintaining the Shine

The easiest way to keep your copper bottom Revereware looking great is to clean it after *every* use. This prevents food residue and stains from building up, making future cleaning much simpler. Warm, soapy water is usually all you need for daily maintenance. Avoid harsh detergents or abrasive scrubbers, as these can scratch the stainless steel and damage the copper. A soft sponge or cloth is your best friend here.

*   Wash immediately after cooking while the pan is still warm.
*   Use a mild dish soap.
*   Rinse thoroughly with warm water.
*   Dry immediately with a soft towel to prevent water spots.

## Tackling Burnt-On Food Residue

Even with careful cooking, burnt-on food happens. Don't panic! There are several effective ways to remove stubborn residue from your copper bottom Revereware. Start by soaking the pan in warm, soapy water for at least 30 minutes. This will help loosen the burnt food. If soaking isn’t enough, create a paste of baking soda and water, apply it to the affected area, and let it sit for a few hours. Gently scrub with a non-abrasive sponge. 

For particularly tough spots, you can simmer a mixture of water and vinegar in the pan for 10-15 minutes. This can help lift the burnt-on food.

## Restoring the Copper's Luster: Polishing Techniques

Over time, the copper bottom of your Revereware will tarnish, losing its bright shine. Restoring the luster is easier than you might think. A simple paste of equal parts baking soda and lemon juice is a fantastic natural polish. Apply the paste to the copper bottom, gently scrub with a soft cloth, and rinse thoroughly. 

Alternatively, you can use a commercially available copper polish, but be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully. Always test the polish in an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn't damage the finish. Remember to rinse and dry the pan thoroughly after polishing.

## Cleaning the Stainless Steel Interior

While the copper bottom gets a lot of attention, don't forget about the stainless steel interior! Stainless steel is generally easy to clean, but it can develop water spots and discoloration over time. For everyday cleaning, warm, soapy water is sufficient. To remove water spots, wipe the interior with a solution of equal parts white vinegar and water. 

For stubborn stains, you can use a stainless steel cleaner. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and rinse thoroughly. Avoid using abrasive scrubbers, as they can scratch the stainless steel.
