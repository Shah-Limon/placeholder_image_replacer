## Is Cleaning Coins With Bleach a Good Idea?

Have you stumbled upon a box of old coins and wondered how to bring back their shine? The idea of using bleach to clean coins might cross your mind, given its powerful cleaning properties. However, using bleach on coins is generally **not recommended** and can actually *decrease* their value. This article will explain why, and explore safer, more effective methods for cleaning your coins. We’ll cover the risks of bleach, alternative cleaning solutions, and how to properly care for your coin collection.

**Takeaway:**

*   Bleach is too harsh for most coins and can cause irreversible damage.
*   Gentle cleaning methods using mild soap and water are preferred.
*   Proper storage is crucial for preventing future tarnishing and corrosion.

**Can you use bleach to clean coins?**

Generally, no. Bleach is a harsh chemical that can corrode metal, damaging the coin’s surface and significantly reducing its numismatic value. It's best to avoid using bleach for coin cleaning.

## Why Bleach Damages Coins

Bleach, containing sodium hypochlorite, is a strong oxidizing agent. This means it reacts with the metal in coins, causing pitting, discoloration, and weakening of the coin’s structure. The damage isn’t always immediately visible, but it’s often permanent.  Different coin metals react differently to bleach. Copper coins can turn a sickly green, silver coins can become pitted and dull, and even gold coins aren’t immune to the corrosive effects.  Using bleach essentially alters the coin’s original surface, making it less desirable to collectors.

Consider the impact on collectible value. Collectors often prefer coins in their original condition, even if they show signs of age.  Aggressive cleaning, like using bleach, removes the coin’s patina – the natural toning that develops over time – and can drastically lower its worth.  If you're unsure about the value of your coins, it's always best to err on the side of caution and avoid harsh cleaning methods.

## Safe Alternatives to Bleach for Cleaning Coins

Fortunately, there are several safer ways to clean coins without risking damage. The best approach depends on the coin’s metal and the type of grime it has accumulated.  For lightly soiled coins, warm distilled water and a mild dish soap (like Dawn) are often sufficient. Gently swirl the coins in the soapy water, then rinse thoroughly with distilled water and pat dry with a soft, lint-free cloth. 

For more stubborn dirt, you can try a specialized coin cleaning solution. These solutions are formulated to remove grime without harming the coin’s surface.  Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully.  Another option is to use a gentle abrasive, like baking soda, mixed with distilled water to create a paste. Apply the paste gently with a soft cloth, then rinse thoroughly.  Remember, less is more when it comes to cleaning coins.  If you're dealing with particularly delicate or valuable coins, consider consulting a professional numismatist.

## Cleaning Different Coin Metals

Different metals require different cleaning approaches. Silver coins, for example, are prone to tarnishing. A silver polish specifically designed for coins can help remove tarnish without causing damage.  However, avoid using abrasive polishes, as they can scratch the surface.  Copper coins can benefit from a gentle cleaning with a solution of vinegar and salt, followed by a thorough rinse. 

Gold coins are generally more resistant to corrosion, but they can still accumulate dirt and grime. A mild soap and water solution is usually sufficient for cleaning gold coins.  Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners.  If you have ancient coins, it's best to avoid cleaning them altogether, as cleaning can damage their historical value.

## The Importance of Distilled Water

Using distilled water is crucial when cleaning coins. Tap water contains minerals and chemicals that can leave residue on the coin’s surface, potentially causing further corrosion. Distilled water is purified and free of these contaminants.  Always rinse coins thoroughly with distilled water after cleaning to remove any traces of soap or cleaning solution. 

Furthermore, distilled water is essential for soaking coins before cleaning. Soaking helps to loosen dirt and grime, making it easier to remove.  Allow the coins to soak for several hours, or even overnight, depending on the level of soiling.  After soaking, gently pat the coins dry with a soft, lint-free cloth.  Avoid rubbing, as this can scratch the surface.

## Proper Coin Storage to Prevent Tarnishing

Cleaning is only part of the equation. Proper storage is essential for preventing future tarnishing and corrosion.  Avoid storing coins in plastic bags or containers, as these can trap moisture and accelerate the corrosion process. Instead, use acid-free coin holders, albums, or capsules.  These materials are designed to protect coins from environmental factors. 

Store your coin collection in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.  Humidity can cause coins to tarnish, while sunlight can fade their color.  Consider using desiccant packets to absorb any excess moisture in the storage area.  Regularly inspect your coin collection for signs of tarnishing or corrosion.  Early detection can help you take preventative measures and preserve the value of your coins.
