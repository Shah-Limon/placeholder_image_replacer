Cleaning chicken gizzards isn’t difficult, but it does require a little patience. Here’s a quick answer: To clean chicken gizzards, remove any fat or membranes, cut them open, discard the contents, rinse thoroughly under cold water, and trim away the tough silver skin before cooking.

## Understanding Chicken Gizzards

Chicken gizzards are the muscular stomach of the chicken, used for grinding food. Because of this function, they can contain undigested food particles and a tough lining.  Don't let this deter you, though! Properly cleaned gizzards are tender and delicious when cooked. They have a slightly gamey flavor and a chewy texture, making them great for stews, stir-fries, or even fried as a snack.  Understanding their function helps you understand *why* thorough cleaning is so important.

## Preparing the Gizzards for Cleaning

Before you start the actual cleaning process, a little preparation goes a long way. First, gently remove the gizzards from the chicken cavity or packaging.  You’ll typically find them alongside the heart and liver. Place the gizzards in a bowl and cover them with cold water. This initial soak helps loosen any debris and makes the next steps easier.  Don't skip this step; it really does make a difference in how easily you can clean them.

## Removing the Silver Skin and Outer Membrane

The silver skin and outer membrane are the toughest parts of the gizzard and need to be removed.  This is where a sharp knife comes in handy.  Carefully slide the tip of your knife under the silver skin and gently lift it away from the gizzard.  It can be slippery, so take your time.  The outer membrane is usually easier to peel off, but you may need to use the knife to get started. Removing these layers significantly improves the texture of the cooked gizzards.

## Cutting Open and Emptying the Gizzard

Now comes the part where you’ll see what the gizzard has been “working” on!  Place a gizzard on a cutting board and carefully cut it open along one side. You’ll likely find a mixture of undigested food, grit, and bile.  Discard this contents – it’s not something you want to eat.  Rinse the inside of the gizzard thoroughly under cold running water to remove any remaining debris.  This step is crucial for ensuring a clean and palatable final product.  Think of it like cleaning out a small, natural pouch.

## Thoroughly Rinsing the Cleaned Gizzards

After emptying the gizzard, it’s time for a thorough rinse. Place the cut-open gizzards in a colander and rinse them under cold running water for several minutes.  Gently rub the surfaces to ensure all traces of debris are removed.  You might want to repeat this process a couple of times to be absolutely sure.  A clean gizzard should be free of any visible grit or discoloration.  Maintaining a clean kitchen is important, and just like you would [clean aluminum](https://beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-aluminum) to keep it looking its best, you want to ensure your ingredients are spotless.

## Final Trim and Preparation for Cooking

Once rinsed, give the gizzards a final trim.  Remove any remaining bits of membrane or fat.  You can also cut the gizzards into smaller, bite-sized pieces at this stage, depending on your recipe.  Pat the gizzards dry with paper towels before cooking. This helps them brown nicely when sautéed or fried.  Now they’re ready to be used in your favorite dish!
