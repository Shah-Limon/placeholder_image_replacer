## Keeping Your Dyson Animal Vacuum in Top Shape

Is your Dyson Animal vacuum losing suction, or just not performing like it used to? A clean vacuum is a happy vacuum, and regular maintenance is key to keeping it running efficiently. This guide will walk you through a comprehensive cleaning process for your Dyson Animal vacuum, ensuring it continues to tackle pet hair and dirt with ease. We’ll cover everything from emptying the bin to washing the filters, so you can restore your vacuum’s power. Let's dive in and get your Dyson Animal sparkling!

**Takeaway:**

*   Empty the bin regularly.
*   Wash the filters every few months.
*   Check for blockages in the wand and brush head.
*   Wipe down the machine’s exterior.

**Quick Answer:** To clean a Dyson Animal vacuum, empty the bin, wash the filters, check for blockages in the wand and brush head, and wipe down the exterior. Regular cleaning maintains suction and extends the life of your vacuum.

## 1. Emptying the Dustbin – The First Step to a Clean Dyson

Let's start with the most frequent task: emptying the dustbin. A full bin significantly reduces suction power, making your vacuum less effective.  Simply detach the bin from your Dyson Animal vacuum by pressing the release button. Then, hold the bin over a trash can and slide the bottom release lever to empty the contents.  Ensure all debris is removed, and give the bin a quick wipe with a damp cloth to remove any lingering dust.

## 2. Washing the Dyson Animal Filters for Optimal Performance

Filters are crucial for trapping fine dust and allergens. Over time, they become clogged, reducing airflow and suction.  Remove the filters from your Dyson Animal vacuum – typically located at the top of the machine.  Wash the filters under cold water until the water runs clear.  Allow the filters to air dry *completely* – this is vital! Using damp filters can damage the motor.

## 3. De-Tangling and Cleaning the Brush Bar

The brush bar is the workhorse of your Dyson Animal vacuum, especially when dealing with pet hair. Hair and fibers can easily wrap around the brush bar, hindering its rotation and reducing cleaning effectiveness.  Detach the brush bar from the cleaner head. Use scissors or a seam ripper to carefully cut away any tangled hair or fibers.  Wipe the brush bar clean with a damp cloth.  Reinstall the brush bar, ensuring it clicks securely into place.  If your brush bar isn't spinning, you might need to investigate further – see this guide on [dyson brush bar not spinning](https://www.beacleaner.com/dyson-brush-bar-not-spinning).

## 4. Checking for Blockages in the Wand and Hose

Blockages are a common cause of reduced suction.  Detach the wand and hose from your Dyson Animal vacuum.  Visually inspect the wand and hose for any obstructions.  Use a long, flexible object – like a broom handle or a coat hanger – to gently dislodge any blockages.  Be careful not to puncture the hose.  If you're still experiencing issues, it might be time to check if your [Dyson vacuum is not spinning](https://www.beacleaner.com/dyson-vacuum-is-not-spinning).

## 5. Cleaning the Dyson Animal’s Cyclone Assembly

The cyclone assembly is responsible for separating dirt and dust from the airflow.  While it doesn’t require frequent cleaning, it’s important to address it when you notice a decrease in performance.  Remove the cyclone assembly according to your vacuum’s manual.  Wipe down the cyclone with a damp cloth, removing any accumulated dust or debris.  Ensure the cyclone is completely dry before reassembling.

## 6. Wiping Down the Exterior of Your Dyson Animal Vacuum

Finally, give the exterior of your Dyson Animal vacuum a good wipe down.  Use a damp cloth with a mild detergent to remove any dust or grime.  Pay attention to the handle, body, and cleaner head.  This not only keeps your vacuum looking clean but also prevents dust from being redistributed during use.  A clean exterior contributes to a more hygienic cleaning experience.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Dyson Animal Issues

Sometimes, even after a thorough cleaning, your Dyson Animal vacuum might still have issues.  Here are a few common problems and potential solutions. If your vacuum won’t turn on, check the power cord and ensure it’s properly plugged in.  If the battery keeps cutting out, consider replacing it – you can find information on [Dyson vacuum battery keeps cutting out](https://www.beacleaner.com/dyson-vacuum-battery-keeps-cutting-out).  If you notice a burning smell, immediately turn off the vacuum and investigate the cause.
