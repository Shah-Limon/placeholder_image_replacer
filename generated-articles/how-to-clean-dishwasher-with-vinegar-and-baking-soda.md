## Sparkling Clean: How to Clean Your Dishwasher With Vinegar and Baking Soda

Is your dishwasher leaving dishes spotty or smelling less than fresh? You don’t need harsh chemicals to get it sparkling clean! This article will show you how to effectively clean your dishwasher with the power of vinegar and baking soda – two readily available, eco-friendly cleaning agents. We’ll cover everything from removing food debris to eliminating odors, ensuring your dishwasher performs its best. Let’s dive into a step-by-step guide to a cleaner, fresher kitchen.

**Takeaway:**

*   Regular cleaning prevents buildup and odors.
*   Vinegar cuts through grease and grime.
*   Baking soda deodorizes and gently scrubs.
*   A clean dishwasher means cleaner dishes!

**Quick Answer:** To clean your dishwasher with vinegar and baking soda, remove debris, sprinkle baking soda on the bottom, run a short hot cycle, then pour in vinegar and run another cycle. This simple process effectively removes buildup and odors.

## Why Clean Your Dishwasher?

You might think a dishwasher cleans *itself* while cleaning your dishes, but that’s not quite true. Over time, food particles, grease, and mineral deposits can accumulate inside, leading to reduced cleaning performance and unpleasant smells. A dirty dishwasher can even leave residue on your dishes! Regular cleaning, about once a month, keeps everything running smoothly and ensures your dishes come out sparkling. It’s a small task that makes a big difference in your kitchen hygiene.

## Gathering Your Supplies

Before you begin, let’s gather everything you’ll need. Luckily, this cleaning method requires minimal supplies, and you likely already have them on hand. You’ll need:

*   White vinegar: This is your degreaser and disinfectant.
*   Baking soda: This acts as a gentle abrasive and deodorizer.
*   Dish soap: For a quick pre-clean.
*   Sponge or cloth: For wiping down surfaces.
*   Old toothbrush: For scrubbing tight spaces.
*   Rubber gloves (optional): To protect your hands.

## Step 1: Initial Dishwasher Prep

First, remove any large food particles or debris from the dishwasher’s drain. This is a crucial step, as these particles can contribute to clogs and odors. Next, give the interior a quick wipe-down with dish soap and a sponge. Pay attention to the door, sides, and any visible grime. This initial cleaning removes loose debris and prepares the dishwasher for a deeper clean. Don't forget to check the spray arms for blockages!

## Step 2: Baking Soda Power

Now it’s time to harness the power of baking soda. Sprinkle about one cup of baking soda across the bottom of the dishwasher. Let it sit overnight. Baking soda helps to absorb odors and loosen any stuck-on food particles. This step is particularly helpful if your dishwasher has a lingering smell. You can also use baking soda to clean a [stove top with baking soda](https://www.beacleaner.com/how-to-clean-a-stove-top-with-baking-soda) for a complete kitchen refresh.

## Step 3: Vinegar Rinse Cycle

After the baking soda has sat overnight, run a short, hot water cycle. This will help to dissolve the baking soda and further loosen any remaining debris. Once the cycle is complete, pour one cup of white vinegar into a dishwasher-safe bowl or measuring cup. Place the bowl on the top rack of the empty dishwasher. Then, run another hot water cycle. The vinegar will help to cut through grease, dissolve mineral deposits, and disinfect the dishwasher interior.

## Step 4: Cleaning the Dishwasher Filter

The dishwasher filter is often overlooked, but it’s a crucial component for maintaining a clean dishwasher. Locate the filter (usually at the bottom of the dishwasher) and remove it. Rinse it thoroughly under hot water, using an old toothbrush to scrub away any stubborn debris. A clogged filter can significantly reduce your dishwasher’s cleaning performance. If you're having trouble locating or cleaning your filter, check your dishwasher's manual.

## Step 5: Final Touches and Maintenance

Once the vinegar cycle is complete, wipe down the dishwasher door and controls with a clean cloth. This removes any lingering residue and leaves the exterior sparkling. To maintain a clean dishwasher, run a vinegar and baking soda cycle once a month. You can also occasionally wipe down the interior with a damp cloth. Regularly cleaning your dishwasher will extend its lifespan and ensure it continues to deliver sparkling clean dishes.
